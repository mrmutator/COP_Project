qy/2482_B	do they ?
ny/2482_A	yes .
sv/2482_A	time spent with mom and dad is , uh , next , is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them .

sv/2482_B	especially when they get like into the teenage stage .
b/2482_A	yeah .
h/2482_B	i guess .
b/2482_B	yeah ,
sd/2482_B	i remember when i was that age .

ny/2482_B	uhhuh .
qy^d/2482_A	you 're working then ?
ny/2482_B	yeah .
sd/2482_A	with every passing day we wonder if we will be .
sd/2482_B	that 's what i heard .
sd/2482_B	i 've always thought about maybe transferring up there ,
sd/2482_B	and i thought if i do that , i might not have a job
%/2482_B	so .
sv/2482_A	it 's , it 's better to be employed .
aa/2482_B	uhhuh .
aa/2482_B	uhhuh .
sv/2482_A	especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner .
aa/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_B	i know it .
sv/2482_A	and that creates family tensions .
aa/2482_B	yeah .
aa/2482_B	yeah ,
sv/2482_B	i 'm sure it does .
qy^d/2482_B	so , you only have the , you only have the stepdaughter at home ?

b/2482_B	uhhuh .
qw/2482_B	so , how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all .
sd/2482_A	uh , well it varies what it is , of course ,
sd/2482_A	but usually ,
+/2482_A	mom and dad are a curse .
b/2482_B	uhhuh ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sv/2482_A	you know , they , they 'd much rather be with friends ,
ba/2482_B	oh , yeah .
sv/2482_A	friends are cool , parents are n't .
aa/2482_B	no ,
aa/2482_B	huhuh .
sd/2482_A	well , i remember ,
sv/2482_A	well i 'm sure part of it is a male , female thing , you know ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_A	i , i remember whenever i was growing up , often times spent with my dad was , oh , just wonderful , you know , go ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	go hunting , or go to the races ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	or , or , oh , any number of things .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_A	and we 'd have , um , great times ,
ba/2482_B	oh , yeah .
sd/2482_A	and it seems that well now the bank 's not available .
b/2482_B	yeah .
b/2482_B	um .
sd/2482_A	and , entirely too much time is spent ,
sd/2482_A	my wife and i were wondering what if ,
+/2482_B	uhhuh .
sv/2482_A	and , and what if 's always rough .
aa/2482_B	oh , yeah .
aa/2482_B	yeah .
sd/2482_A	but , you know , we do have our trips
sd/2482_A	and we do have our fun
sv/2482_A	and ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	i do n't know , little girls are n't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were .
bf/2482_B	like fishing and ...
^2/2482_A	hunting and , and ,
b/2482_B	yeah .
+/2482_A	looking for arrowheads , and ...
sd/2482_B	my husband will say that he 'd like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing
sd/2482_B	and i said , well , you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily .
sv/2482_A	uh , but they do n't like it .
aap_am/2482_B	that 's probably right .
sv/2482_A	there , there , there is a difference there .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
%/2482_A	and , and ...
aa/2482_B	no ,
sd/2482_B	if my dad had done that when i was a kid i probably would n't have liked it .
sd/2482_B	i go now , with my husband .
sd/2482_B	and , i enjoy it ,
%/2482_B	but ...
sv/2482_A	well , girls at that age ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	video games , boys and malls .
b/2482_B	yeah ,
b/2482_B	yeah .
sv/2482_A	not necessarily in that order ,
+/2482_A	and friends of course .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sv/2482_A	and , that 's a little tough for fathers .
aa/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_B	i imagine .
sv/2482_A	fathers do n't even like malls ,
sv/2482_A	they despise shopping .
%/2482_B	uh .
qh/2482_A	so , is that quality time ?
b/2482_B	huh ,
aa/2482_B	no ,
sd/2482_B	i think not .
b/2482_A	yeah ,
%/2482_A	if ,
sd/2482_A	but there is camping
sd/2482_A	and we both enjoy that .
b/2482_B	uhhuh ,
qy^d/2482_B	she likes to do that ?
ny/2482_A	somewhat , yeah ,
ny/2482_A	yeah .
b/2482_B	yeah
b/2482_B	, yeah .
ba/2482_B	well , that 's good .
sd/2482_A	getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all
sd/2482_A	and ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	that 's somewhat fun .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
%/2482_B	she ...
%/2482_A	it 's ,
br/2482_B	huh ?
qo/2482_A	so what do you think about child rearing ?
%/2482_A	is ,
qw/2482_A	how , how would you spend time with kids ?
sd/2482_B	probably doing outdoorsie stuff , and keeping , trying to keep them away from the t v , i guess . and , mcdonald 's .
ba/2482_A	oh , yeah .
sd/2482_B	i , i always said that if i had a kid they would n't know what mcdonald 's is .
b/2482_A	yeah ,
%/2482_A	but
sv/2482_B	but , they learn from their friends ,
^g/2482_B	do n't they ?
ny/2482_A	well , yeah ,
sd/2482_A	and amazingly a lot of times it 's real easy .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_A	you know , a lot of times , whenever we head out of town on a trip or something ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	it 's real easy to swing in there for breakfast .
b/2482_B	yeah .
sd/2482_A	breakfast and run .
b/2482_B	yeah .
sv/2482_A	and breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway ,
aa/2482_B	yeah .
aa/2482_B	it is .
sv/2482_A	and , uh , kids eat funny .
sd/2482_B	this lady in our bass club , we had a tournament yesterday
sd/2482_B	and she was talking about her daughter , said , one week her daughter will , uh , be on a no meat kick ,
sd/2482_B	and one week she 'll eat nothing but twix candy bars , you know ,
sd/2482_B	she just eats weird .
sv/2482_A	and little girls are worse about it than little boys .
b/2482_B	yeah ,
b/2482_B	yeah .
%/2482_A	they ...
sv/2482_B	they 're always wanting to go on a diet or something .
aap_am/2482_A	or , or something , yeah .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_A	go on a diet or they , they have a , well ,
sv/2482_A	to some extent the public schools , or the schools in general ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	influence them ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	the eating meat kick .
b/2482_B	yeah .
sd/2482_A	you know , like it 's really morally wrong to eat meat or something ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	i , i 'm not sure .
sd/2482_A	of course , that 's not the way i was raised , being raised in west texas .
b/2482_B	yeah .
qy/2482_B	oh , is that where you 're from ?
ny/2482_A	oh , yeah .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_A	born in denton , raised in lubbock .
b/2482_B	oh . um .
sd/2482_A	so , i understand about bass .
b/2482_B	yeah
b/2482_B	. huh .
sv/2482_A	but it , but it is interesting ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
^h/2482_A	i , i will tell you ,
%/2482_A	yeah .
sv/2482_A	every person out there should have kids , at least once or , or have some they can borrow for a time ,
sd/2482_B	that 's the kind i like .
+/2482_A	because everyone needs some torture in their lives .
sd/2482_B	my mother used to put that curse on my sister .
^q/2482_B	i hope you have kids just like yourself .
sd/2482_B	and , my grandmother must have put that on my dad because he got my sister ,
sd/2482_B	she 's just like him .
sd/2482_A	uh . but , jenny is a sweet kid .
b/2482_B	yeah ,
sv/2482_B	i 'm sure she is .
b/2482_A	and , yeah ,
sd/2482_A	we do do things ,
b/2482_B	yeah .
sd/2482_A	and , it , it 's funny ,
sd/2482_A	it 's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
+/2482_A	to go do ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_A	the money 's not available .
aa/2482_B	uhhuh ,
aa/2482_B	i know ,
sd/2482_B	i do n't know how people can afford kids .
%/2482_B	i mean ...
sd/2482_A	you know , we were talking about how much it cost to go to disney land .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
ba/2482_A	golly !
sd/2482_A	a couple ,
sd/2482_A	three hundred dollars .
ba/2482_B	oh , yeah .
sd/2482_A	you know , for just , for just a day , not in , you know , a day or two , not including lodging and food and all that .
b/2482_B	uhhuh ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
%/2482_A	it 's ,
sd/2482_A	i do n't see how anyone can afford it .
%/2482_B	uh .
sd/2482_A	and , i understand six flags is real expensive now .
%/2482_B	it 's , uh ,
sd/2482_B	i heard it 's twenty bucks a whack .
sd/2482_B	for adults .
ba/2482_A	oh , yeah .
b/2482_B	yeah .
sv/2482_B	that is awful high .
%/2482_B	oh , well ...
b^m/2482_A	twenty bucks a whack now .
aa/2482_B	yeah ,
sd/2482_B	or twentyone .
sd/2482_A	but , at least once you pay your way in there ,
b/2482_B	yeah ,
b/2482_B	yeah .
+/2482_A	at six flags ...
b/2482_B	yeah ,
sd/2482_B	everything 's free except for the food .
b/2482_A	yeah ,
b/2482_A	yeah ,
bf/2482_A	food and junk to carry out .
sv/2482_A	so that 's , that 's not as bad .
b/2482_B	yeah .
b/2482_B	yeah .
ba/2482_A	but , golly !
sd/2482_A	you know , disney world or disney land .
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sd/2482_A	well , our problem is that , you know , a trip to six flags or disney world or , uh , disney land , or god forbid , disney world , would take forever .
b/2482_B	really .
sd/2482_A	or you 'd have to pay air fare ,
b/2482_B	uhhuh .
sv/2482_A	and , ooh , for a family , you know , for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick .
ba/2482_B	oh , yeah .
sd/2482_A	rent a car when you get there and all that .
%/2482_A	yeah .
sd/2482_B	that 's why i lucked out ,
sd/2482_B	my dad worked for braniff when i was a kid so we got , you know , our air fare free
sd/2482_B	and we got ...
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2006_A	all righty .
sd/2006_A	uh , i guess our topic today is air pollution .
sd/2006_A	and we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution , as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us .
aa/2006_B	right .
qy/2006_A	um , does your work entitle , uh , anything of environmental along these lines ?
sd/2006_B	me , i 'm in the legal department
sd/2006_B	and , um , we do have , uh , a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues .
b/2006_A	uhhuh .
sd/2006_B	and i do n't know too much about the air pollution thing .
sd/2006_B	i do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that t i has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground , you know , we 're coming up with a , uh , a new solution .
sd/2006_B	we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump
sd/2006_B	and we just transport to these places .
sd/2006_B	but after awhile it always seems that the , um , oh , the site starts to leak
sd/2006_B	and then you have to clean it up and such .
sd/2006_B	but the new idea is to take everything up to sherman ,
sd/2006_B	and we 're going have that , you know , incineration place up there and ,
b/2006_A	right .
+/2006_B	dump everything there .
sd/2006_B	and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i 've heard , that everything would be in , in , you know , a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up .
sd/2006_B	and that we wo n't be polluting the air .
sd/2006_B	i 'm sure we have to have , uh , permits , you know , for that place . and that there 's , you know , limits as to what we can , uh , let , you know , go into the air .
b/2006_A	yeah .
%/2006_A	it 's , uh , hav , uh , uh , well ,
sd/2006_A	i work in , i work in environmentals , uh , projects right now .
bk/2006_B	oh , okay .
sd/2006_A	and so the sherman deal is , um , uh , lost a lot of hair over that project .
b/2006_B	oh .
sd/2006_A	uh , what we run into , um , is we have the texas air control board , t a c b , that send out , uh , jurisdictions under which we have to , uh , uh , reply to .
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
sd/2006_A	and a lot of their rules and regulation are n't real clear , so we have our manager of environmental , who assist the t a c b , which is located in austin , in writing
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2006_A	and , hey ,
ad/2006_A	look what we 've done here at t i .
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
sd/2006_A	and , uh , we are presently , uh , in receipt of a site permit , which will allow us to , um , uh ,
sd/2006_A	this is our side a ,
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
+/2006_A	allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage .
sd/2006_A	it 's in ,
b/2006_B	okay .
+/2006_A	in , in tons per year . um ,
sd/2006_A	and so , w , w , you know , what we do to make contributions so that , basically , we go and do things like put in hightech scrubber systems , uh , that , uh , scrub out the , n o x and , uh , v o c 's and , and ammonia compounds , uh , like all the acids , to a certain level .
sd/2006_A	we ,
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
+/2006_A	are very , um , aware of the opacity , which is the thickness of a stack emissions .
sd/2006_A	so if you do n't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts .
sd/2006_A	and so what we go through is , uh , if you see it smoking there 's a problem .
sd/2006_A	and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely , uh , it becomes a real issue , especially , when it 's smoking
sd/2006_A	and you have to get it fixed el pronto .
%/2006_B	um .
sd/2006_A	as you know , they , they 're allowed to come on site , the federaldes , anytime they want , drive through , and see , and inspect .
%/2006_B	um .
sd/2006_A	so it 's a full time , uh , everybody has their home phone number type of job . um ,
qy/2006_B	now is that place built
qrr/2006_B	or you 're still on the makings of it ?
sd/2006_A	the sherman facility , we are still in the , closer too , but still have a little bit of , um , finalization to do .
%/2006_A	right .
sd/2006_A	it 's been pitched to the sherman city council with , um ,
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
+/2006_A	open arms , as well as the public .
sd/2006_A	we had open forum
sd/2006_A	and , and , uh , uh , tom jones , our environmental , corporate environmental guys handle the project .
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
sd/2006_A	and , uh , its real , uh , going real well .
sd/2006_A	i think it 's matter , just a matter of fund ,
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
+/2006_A	funds right now as i understand it . uh ,
sd/2006_A	but it 's , uh , it 's something else .
%/2006_A	yeah .
sd/2006_A	they 're , they 're , they 're in the same issue .
sd/2006_A	we were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there .
sd/2006_A	uh , because the , the system is setup where it wo n't have any emissions .
sd/2006_A	you 're correct .
sd/2006_A	it will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was ,
b/2006_B	right .
+/2006_A	it was human nature .
sd/2006_A	but it wo n't have can any , uh , any bad stuff .
sd/2006_A	so , uh , i think t i , we spend , of all the major semiconductor firms , we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost , foremost , uh , uh , first thing we always look at .
sd/2006_A	and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm i know of .
sd/2006_A	we eat and sleep the stuff , everything we do over here .
x/2006_B	.
sd/2006_A	and , uh , it 's an interesting job .
%/2006_A	but um ,
sd/2006_B	well , i know from some of the sites that we 've had , uh , quite a list of cites that have gone bad
sd/2006_B	and you have to clean up .
sd/2006_B	and , you know the law now is the super fund
sd/2006_B	and anybody who 's contributed toxic waste , no matter if you were somebody that eventually , you know , uh , damaged the ground or not .
sd/2006_B	uh , everybody has to contribute
sd/2006_B	and it 's been a lot of big bucks when we 've gotten , uh , gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and , you know , mega bucks to , uh , you know take everything out and redo it and , you know , fill in some other area
sd/2006_B	and , um , certainly , it would to have a better solution , like the sherman facility than , um , just letting it go in the ground .
sd/2006_B	because eventually , you know , it , it seems that no matter what they do , if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined , uh , dump area .
sd/2006_B	it still only in time starts to leak out .
aap_am/2006_A	possibly .
b/2006_B	yeah .
b/2006_A	uhhuh .
sd/2006_B	there , there was one site that they cleaned up
sd/2006_B	and then the new place leaked again . .
aa/2006_A	yeah .
sd/2006_A	i 'm familiar with that one .
x/2006_B	.
sd/2006_A	we have , we have stuff that 's very interesting , uh ,
sd/2006_A	we have hoods ,
sd/2006_A	we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where , um , they have , um , that we sample
sd/2006_B	uhhuh .
sd/2006_A	and it may have over , uh , a certain emission levels ,
sd/2006_A	this is on the solid side ,
sd/2006_A	and so we take it
sd/2006_A	and , uh , we ca n't deep well inject something like that because it 's a solid .
sd/2006_A	and we mix it with concrete
b/2006_B	uhhuh .
+/2006_A	and actually , um , potash , per se , and concrete and then actually put it in the ground . but not so , not in a hazardous waste location because it 's , basically , a concrete slab .
%/2006_B	um .
sd/2006_A	it was totally legal .
sd/2006_A	but the cost of doing this is astronomical ,
%/2006_B	um ,
+/2006_A	they actually show you what duckwork and things .
sd/2006_A	and so we were , uh , very , very , uh , cognizance of , and aware of all these types of , uh , expenditures because it could get very expensive .
sd/2006_A	but i think we , uh , you know , we do all kinds of things to make the , the world a better place to live , you know ,
sd/2006_A	i think some of the folks that are n't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that .
sd/2006_A	i really would .
sd/2006_A	um , i 've enjoyed speaking with you ,
b/2006_B	yeah .
sv/2006_A	this has been an interesting topic .
sd/2006_A	uh , i was one of the ,
sd/2006_A	i was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate , or in the north building .
bh/2006_B	oh , you were ?
ny/2006_A	yeah .
bk/2006_B	oh , okay .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2006_A	so , uh , i hope you like your office .
aa/2006_B	yes .
aa/2006_B	yes .
sd/2006_B	it 's a heck of a lot different .
sd/2006_B	and we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk .
sd/2006_B	we were about the only ,
b/2006_A	yeah .
+/2006_B	place in , you know , t i that had the gray metal desk .
sd/2006_B	people used to come and laugh and go , gee , i had n't seen one of those ten , fifteen years .
b/2006_A	yeah .
x/2006_B	.
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2006_A	glad to see y'all taken care of .
sv/2006_A	well , the , uh , i think what changed everything and , uh , is , uh , y'all were , y'all were the only ones that make any money for ti , here in the last ten years ,
sd/2006_B	we ,
+/2006_A	ju ,
+/2006_B	finally got a little respect .
sv/2006_B	nobody thought of us as a profit center before .
aa/2006_A	exactly .
sv/2006_A	and that 's , um , when , when you start , when you start paying your way , uh , you know , jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys .
aa/2006_B	right .
aa/2006_B	right .
%/2006_A	i was just ,
sv/2006_B	not just overhead .
aa/2006_A	exactly .
fc/2006_A	i 've enjoyed speaking with you .
fc/2006_B	you too .
fc/2006_A	see you later .
fc/2006_A	byebye .
fc/2006_B	bye .
sd/3320_A	we 're supposed to talk about crime in the city .
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
qy/3320_A	and , uh , seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays , does n't it ?
%/3320_B	well , uh , i ,
%/3320_B	that 's ,
na/3320_B	sure .
%/3320_B	uh , i , i think it 's
sv/3320_B	s , st , statistics , obviously , vary greatly .
sv/3320_B	i always thought of dallas as being a fairly safe place .
aa/3320_A	well , it is ,
sv/3320_A	but our crimes up here , uh , as i think it must be in most cities now ,
sd/3320_A	but , uh , i was listening to the news the other day
sd/3320_A	and they said they thought a lot of it , the reason it was up so was because of the , uh , so many people are without work nowadays ,
sd/3320_A	economy 's so bad .
qy/3320_B	do you really believe that ?
sv/3320_B	i mean , it , it 's been up every year for many years
qy/3320_B	and the economy has n't been ,
x/3320_A	.
+/3320_B	this bad for so long , has it ?
ba/3320_A	that 's a good point .
sd/3320_A	that 's just what they quoted over the news .
b/3320_B	yeah .
no/3320_A	i do n't know if i believe that or not ,
sv/3320_A	but , it , it does seem up
%/3320_A	and ,
qw/3320_B	what kind of newspaper do you get down there ?
qw/3320_A	what kind ?
ny/3320_B	yeah .
sd/3320_A	well , we got a , i think we got a pretty good newspaper .
sd/3320_A	uh , we have two , the morning news and the , uh , times herald .
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
sd/3320_A	morning news seems to have the largest circulation .
sd/3320_A	i think it 's a pretty good ,
sd/3320_A	it 's a locally owned paper .
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
sd/3320_A	the herald is owned , i think , by the times out of , uh , l a , or somewhere .
b/3320_B	yes .
%/3320_A	but ,
qy/3320_B	d , do they , do they play up the local crime angles
%/3320_B	or d , or do they ,
ng/3320_A	well , they do n't ,
nn/3320_A	no ,
sd/3320_A	not really , uh ,
sd/3320_A	they do n't play it up , i do n't think .
sd/3320_A	uh , but there , there is too much of it , you know , uh
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
+/3320_A	too many homes broken into .
b/3320_B	yeah .
%/3320_A	we had our , our , fact about , uh ,
sd/3320_A	last year sometime our home was broken into .
bh/3320_B	really ?
%/3320_A	we ,
qy^d/3320_B	so this is a topic of personal interest .
ny/3320_A	yeah ,
%/3320_A	we , uh , uh ,
sd/3320_A	i did n't think ours ever would be burgled into , burgled ,
sd/3320_A	but , so many in our neighborhood had been ,
sd/3320_A	and , uh , because we live on a corner
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
+/3320_A	and back up to a real , uh , highly traveled main street .
b/3320_B	yeah .
%/3320_A	but , uh , we were , so , uh ,
bf/3320_B	so , so you saw this happening in your neighborhood
bf/3320_B	and you figured it would n't happen to you .
aa/3320_A	sort of , yeah .
sd/3320_A	and i never did get a security system ,
sd/3320_A	but since that happened , i certainly have .
b/3320_B	yeah ,
qw/3320_B	what kind of system do you have ?
sd/3320_A	it 's , uh , uh , i guess , excuse me , just a standard . uh , , with the , uh , all the doors and the , uh , infrared thing , you know , motion detector .
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
sd/3320_A	pre ,
qy/3320_B	is ,
+/3320_A	pretty standard .
+/3320_B	is this , is this one with some company that , that services you and
ny/3320_A	yes ,
ny/3320_A	yes .
+/3320_B	takes your calls and all that stuff ?
sd/3320_A	it 's monitored and all that .
b/3320_B	yeah .
%/3320_A	and ,
qy/3320_B	well , is that a necessary feature to have somebody , you know , at the other end of the line
qrr/3320_B	or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise ?
sv/3320_A	i think , uh , the thing that makes a lot of noise would , would suffice .
b/3320_B	yeah .
sv/3320_A	i really do .
sd/3320_A	but , uh , this deal that was part of it for , you know , three years or so
b/3320_B	yeah .
+/3320_A	to pay the unit off or whatever .
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
%/3320_A	and , uh , but it , uh ,
sd/3320_A	the monitoring is not that bad , though
sd/3320_A	because , uh , uh , we 've goofed it up , you know ,
sd/3320_A	several times you 'll hit the wrong key , not intentionally or something
sd/3320_A	and , and they call back pretty quickly ,
sd/3320_A	so i guess it 's , you know , i think it 's all right .
%/3320_A	but i ,
sv/3320_A	to answer your question , i think , uh
b/3320_B	yeah .
+/3320_A	uh , i think , uh , that is a pretty good deterrent in itself ,
%/3320_A	whether it ,
qy^d/3320_B	s , s , so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system .
qy/3320_A	uhhuh .
qw/3320_B	and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line ?
sd/3320_A	well , it 's got a back up system that does n't work supposedly . tha , uh , that if it 's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway . supposedly .
qw/3320_B	how does it do that ?
no/3320_A	who knows , you know .
sv/3320_A	but that 's a selling point .
sd/3320_A	and i think they 're probably , i think it probably does these things or sur , supposedly pretty good .
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
sv/3320_A	boy , they sure advertise them , you know , so many of them nowadays .
aa/3320_B	sure .
qy/3320_A	but , uh , well do n't , do n't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there ?
ny/3320_B	well , yeah , uh ,
sd/3320_A	i 'm not saying it 's any higher than anybody else 's .
sd/3320_A	down here , we seem to ,
%/3320_A	or , or not here ,
sv/3320_A	but the statistics seem to say that .
h/3320_A	i do n't know .
sv/3320_B	i , i think it 's the murder capital of the country now .
bh/3320_A	is that right ?
ny/3320_B	yes .
sv/3320_A	i would gather probably from drugs .
aa/3320_B	absolutely .
sv/3320_A	and i think that 's the reason it 's so high everywhere .
b/3320_B	yeah .
sv/3320_A	but , i do n't think there 's anyplace ,
%/3320_A	used to ,
sv/3320_A	years ago , you thought , well , these little small cities and all , would n't have that problem ,
sv/3320_A	but they do .
b/3320_B	yeah .
sd/3320_A	we 've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it , uh , as anyone , you know .
qh/3320_B	s , s , so , what 's the solution ?
ba/3320_A	that 's a good question .
no/3320_A	i do n't know ,
no/3320_A	i do n't know what the solution is .
no/3320_A	i really do n't .
sv/3320_B	and all these politicians make , make hay over , you know
b/3320_A	yeah .
+/3320_B	being anticrime ,
sv/3320_B	but
b/3320_A	yep .
+/3320_B	they have n't seemed to have changed anything .
%/3320_A	th ,
sv/3320_A	and nothing seems to change .
sv/3320_A	and , uh , i 'm not sure that anything will because these , if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it
b/3320_B	uhhuh .
sv/3320_A	uh , but , they want to buy it ,
%/3320_A	so ,
b/3320_B	yeah .
sv/3320_A	supply and demand .
sv/3320_A	long as somebody wants to buy it , somebody going to provide it for them .
sd/3320_A	so , i do n't know , i do n't got , you know , i do n't know what the solution is ,
sd/3320_A	i really do n't .
b/3320_B	yeah .
sv/3320_A	i do n't think anyone does , in fact .
b/3320_B	yeah ,
%/3320_B	what ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/3254_A	okay .
qw/3254_A	where do you enjoy dining out ?
sd/3254_B	oh , i generally go to the quickie places just because they 're cheap .
b/3254_A	yes ,
qy/3254_A	do you have children ?
na/3254_B	uh , we have four ,
sd/3254_B	but most of them are gone now
b/3254_A	uh .
%/3254_B	so there , there might be ,
sd/3254_B	but we were taking , you know , uh , four , five and six people out .
b/3254_A	yeah ,
qy/3254_A	that makes a difference , does n't it .
ny/3254_B	yes .
qw/3254_A	what area of the country do you live in ?
sd/3254_B	i 'm in texas .
b/3254_A	yes ,
sd/3254_A	i am , too .
%/3254_A	but ,
sd/3254_B	and we live , we lived in ohio prior to this .
sd/3254_A	i did , too .
sd/3254_A	i 'm from the dayton area .
b/3254_A	oh .
b/3254_B	yeah ,
sd/3254_B	uh , but i look for service even at the quickie places
b/3254_A	uhhuh .
+/3254_B	type things .
sv/3254_B	uh , i do n't like to go to the drivethrus because sometimes they get your order wrong
aa/3254_A	that 's right .
sv/3254_B	and then you 're stuck
sv/3254_B	and it 's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave
b/3254_A	yes .
sd/3254_B	so i really do n't like the drivethrus that much .
sd/3254_B	i , i like to go and eat there .
sd/3254_B	but i would say service , uh , atmosphere , and whether the food is good ,
sd/3254_B	and on going out , i like steaks .
sd/3254_B	so , we try to hit those places when we can .
sd/3254_A	when we travel we look for wendy 's because we have kids ,
sd/3254_A	and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals
b/3254_B	uhhuh .
sd/3254_A	and then that way they can get their burgers and fries
sd/3254_A	and we can have a salad bar
b/3254_B	yeah .
sd/3254_A	so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a wendy 's ,
+/3254_A	because it 's all either mcdonald 's or dairy queens ,
sv/3254_B	and , in , in , in the countries , unless it 's a large city , i guess dairy queen and walmart are their main .
aa/3254_A	right ,
aa/3254_A	that 's right ,
sv/3254_B	that 's what you find ,
aa/3254_B	right ,
aa/3254_A	i know .
sd/3254_B	my husband likes , uh , dairy queens .
sd/3254_B	he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese
b/3254_A	uhhuh .
+/3254_B	dogs , i guess ,
sd/3254_B	so he 's a fan of , of dairy queen ,
sd/3254_B	and , and we 'll go even in town here at times , just as a , a change although
b/3254_A	uhhuh .
+/3254_B	i 'm not that excited about it .
sd/3254_B	but we 've eat , we eat out so much it 's gotten so i do n't like to really eat any place
sd/3254_B	but yet i hate to cook food at home
b/3254_A	oh .
sd/3254_B	so that might be why i look for inexpensive places
b/3254_A	uhhuh .
+/3254_B	just because we 're eating out probably five nights a week
b/3254_A	um .
+/3254_B	maybe .
sd/3254_B	or we eat junk food at home
b/3254_A	yeah .
%/3254_B	uh , now my husba ,
qw/3254_A	well , what are some of your , your favorite inexpensive places ?
sd/3254_B	oh , we 'll go to them all .
sd/3254_B	we sort of take turns .
%/3254_B	and we , uh
%/3254_B	i sort of favor the ones ,
sd/3254_B	if i have a coupon we can go there
sd/3254_B	and if not we ca n't , because it 's cheaper
b/3254_A	uhhuh .
sd/3254_B	so mine is , monetarily , i guess strongly monetarily based .
sd/3254_B	uh , we 'll go get pizza and , uh , at little caesar 's , although the kids prefer domino 's .
sd/3254_A	oh , we are little caesar fans here
b/3254_B	right .
sd/3254_A	that 's where we always go ,
sv/3254_B	but it 's just a lot cheaper than , than domino 's ,
%/3254_B	so that 's .
sd/3254_B	we go to grandy 's quite a bit i would say .
aa/3254_A	yes ,
sd/3254_A	we like grandy 's , too .
sd/3254_B	mcdonald 's , uh , we 've sort of been off of that for a while
sd/3254_B	and no particular reason ,
%/3254_B	and i ,
sd/3254_B	maybe we avoided wendy 's the last few years because our daughter worked there
sd/3254_B	and she never wanted us to show up there
b/3254_A	oh .
sd/3254_B	so , i do n't , we do n't go there that much .
qw/3254_A	where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out , or a big meal ?
^h/3254_B	a nice meal , oh ,
qw/3254_A	where do you go for steaks ?
sd/3254_B	it 's usually when we 're out of town
b/3254_A	oh .
sd/3254_B	and i 'll order steak or steak and lobster combined
b/3254_A	uhhuh .
sd/3254_B	so it 's really not in town .
b/3254_A	oh .
qy/3254_A	you ever been to houston 's on belt line ?
nn/3254_B	no .
sd/3254_A	that 's where we go to get steaks
b/3254_B	uhhuh .
sd/3254_A	they have a teriyaki steak there ,
sd/3254_A	and when we have something to celebrate , we head to houston 's .
sd/3254_A	they do n't take reservations ,
sd/3254_A	and you wind up waiting about an hour
b/3254_B	uhhuh .
sd/3254_A	but the food is good ,
sd/3254_A	and they 've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink , unless you get there at five o'clock ,
sd/3254_A	then you can go right through .
b/3254_B	right .
sd/3254_A	but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks ,
sd/3254_A	so , that 's our nice place to go .
sd/3254_A	we do n't usually take the kids when we go there ,
sd/3254_B	but well , we do n't go out that much ,
sd/3254_B	i gue , well , i guess we do go out without kids .
sd/3254_B	we 're usually picking things up quickly ,
sd/3254_B	though
b/3254_A	yeah .
+/3254_B	we just do n't dwell on food too much ,
sd/3254_B	and , uh , with my husband traveling he can get all he needs
b/3254_A	right ,
+/3254_B	of that during the week going to those places
aa/3254_A	that 's right .
sd/3254_B	so , it does n't really matter to him .
sd/3254_B	he 'd probably just like to stay home .
aa/3254_A	yeah ,
sd/3254_A	that 's the way with my husband .
sd/3254_A	he 's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends ,
sd/3254_A	and i 've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere ,
sd/3254_B	.
sd/3254_A	so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend .
+/3254_B	well , i think , i , i never have liked to cook food ,
sd/3254_B	but i think it all began eating out when we had , uh , the boys in , in different , uh , baseball
b/3254_A	right .
+/3254_B	on baseball tea ,
sd/3254_B	it was mainly baseball teams
b/3254_A	yes .
sd/3254_B	and my husband would coach ,
sd/3254_B	so we were never home at the same time .
b/3254_A	uhhuh .
sd/3254_B	i 'm not one that 's going to fix , you know , the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever
b/3254_A	right .
+/3254_B	they 're there .
sv/3254_B	or you go you know
aa/3254_A	yep .
+/3254_B	you fend for yourself .
sv/3254_B	you go somewhere else .
ad/2672_A	start .
qw/2672_B	what kind of recycling programs do you have in rowlett ?
%/2672_A	um , th ,
sd/2672_A	well right now they 've got a , kind of a central location off of the main highway ,
sd/2672_A	and they 've got some great big bins there for newspaper , um , plastic , um , i think three bins for glass , white , green , and whatev , whatever other combination there is .
x/2672_B	.
sd/2672_A	and , and i think they 've got a comp , uh , some kind of container for aluminum .
sd/2672_B	plano 's doing real good on that .
sd/2672_B	they have , uh , they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans .
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
+/2672_B	which we 're supposed to put all our week 's garbage into it ,
sd/2672_B	and of course it does n't fit right now .
b/2672_A	yeah .
sd/2672_B	but now we start in may , breaking it down ,
sd/2672_B	and they 're picking it all up .
%/2672_A	um .
sd/2672_B	so they 're going to by ,
sd/2672_B	and we have to separate our papers , and our glass ,
sd/2672_B	and then , uh , they have one day for , like , um , oh , everything you picked up from your yard ,
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sd/2672_B	and we put that in disposable bags ,
sd/2672_B	and they pick that up on monday .
b/2672_A	um .
sd/2672_B	so it 's really great .
sd/2672_B	i , i 'm really going head , you know , completely for it ,
sd/2672_B	i think it 's marvelous .
ba/2672_A	well , that 's good .
sd/2672_A	well , rowlett had sent , sent out a survey , not too long ago , um , in terms in how many people were interested in having a , a pick up , i guess , on the days they do trash or something like that .
sd/2672_A	and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorl , favorably , because they 're going to do it .
sd/2672_A	i do n't know how , how soon they 're going to do it , or how organized it 's going to be ,
sd/2672_A	but they 're , they 're supposed to initiate that some , sometime in the next couple of months .
qy/2672_B	well , does your , uh ,
qy/2672_B	where you work , do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that ?
no/2672_A	um , i 've never noticed that .
sd/2672_A	we do n't have a , a whole lot , because we 're in a hospital setting ,
sd/2672_A	so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria . um ,
qy/2672_B	well , down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your , you know , pop cans , and things like that ?
nn/2672_A	um , no .
sd/2672_A	there 's , there 's only one pop machine
sd/2672_A	and it 's not accessible to the cafeteria now ,
sd/2672_A	so , uh , mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea .
bf/2672_B	so you do n't have much choice there .
aa/2672_A	no .
sd/2672_A	not , not really .
sd/2672_B	well i work at , uh , j c penny
sd/2672_B	and last week they brought ,
sd/2672_B	they have a sign up that says for one full week
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
+/2672_B	you bring in your old wire hangers
sd/2672_B	and they 're going to recycle them .
%/2672_A	um .
sd/2672_B	so it 's getting people clean out their closets and such .
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sd/2672_B	and then like , the week before that , they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good , bring it in
sd/2672_B	and they brought it down to the shelters .
sd/2672_B	and , they have , one , two , they have three , i think , that i know of
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
+/2672_B	for cans for people have pop ,
sd/2672_B	and they put them right near where they have the time cards .
b/2672_A	yeah .
sd/2672_B	and it works great .
sd/2672_B	and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too .
ba/2672_A	that 's good .
sd/2672_B	so they 're really going at it ,
sd/2672_B	and i think it 's marvelous because ,
b/2672_A	yeah .
sd/2672_A	i , i guess rowlett 's done a lot for the size town it is .
%/2672_B	well ,
sd/2672_A	and i think they 're trying to , to make some changes .
sd/2672_A	i , i noticed at the library or someplace this past , uh , month , month and a half ago , they were having a speaker , um , talk about doing lawn work and , h , how important it is to , to cut your lawn without a bag . just to kind of mulch it ,
b/2672_B	uhhuh .
+/2672_A	rather than bag it up , because of a , all the the grass that 's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff ,
sd/2672_A	and it 's , uh , i guess a lot more e , ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil .
qy/2672_B	well , did you watch the program the other night on , um , was it save america ?
na/2672_A	i saw part of that .
sv/2672_B	it was good .
sd/2672_B	the only thing i g , thought , um , that i have n't been trying , is when i , you know , go to take a shower , to save the water ,
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
+/2672_B	and to put it on my plants . which i had never thought about before .
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sd/2672_B	but i 've already gone to ,
sd/2672_B	oh i started years ago , i guess , not years ago ,
%/2672_B	but , yeah
sd/2672_B	i would say five years ago , turning off my fountain , i mean my water faucet ,
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
+/2672_B	in the sink when i brush my teeth .
sd/2672_B	but i did n't realize that was the biggest waste of water .
b/2672_A	yeah .
sd/2672_B	that was surprising to me .
%/2672_A	um .
sd/2672_B	i missed that question , totally , i mean really bad .
sd/2672_B	i 'm trying to think ,
sd/2672_B	i did n't miss too many ,
sd/2672_B	i ca n't remember what my score was ,
sd/2672_B	but i did exceeding well .
sd/2672_B	i was surprised .
sd/2672_B	but i did n't realize that our garbage is n't being decomposed .
sd/2672_B	that was a shocker to me .
b/2672_A	yeah ,
sd/2672_A	well there are a lot of things that are n't ,
%/2672_A	i 'm ,
sd/2672_A	that 's , uh , one of the things i wonder about ,
sd/2672_A	uh , one of the questions was , do you think more should be done , or something else .
sd/2672_A	i , i wonder about some of the prod , products that they do n't take , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take . uh , why , why they could n't do more recycling with those .
sd/2672_B	well , i was in , uh , bizmart the other day ,
sd/2672_B	and , what i do n't understand is there is recycled paper in there ,
sd/2672_B	and it cost more than regular paper .
%/2672_A	um .
sd/2672_B	and it was only , i think , uh , forty cents more , you know , fifty cents more ,
sd/2672_B	but ,
b/2672_A	yeah .
+/2672_B	it upset me to realize that , hey , the recycling that they 're going through the expense of recycling ,
sd/2672_B	but people are n't buying it ,
sd/2672_B	so the cost of it is higher .
ba/2672_A	true .
b/2672_A	yeah ,
sd/2672_A	i noticed that about things like
sd/2672_A	i s , i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and , and lawn additives and that type of thing ,
sd/2672_A	but the cost is , is like , double or sometimes triple ,
b/2672_B	uhhuh .
+/2672_A	what the regular things you , fertilizers and things you buy .
%/2672_A	so , in , in terms of that ,
%/2672_A	it 's ,
sv/2672_A	you know , and , for the environment it 's , it 's , there 's a good reason to do it ,
sv/2672_A	but the cost is kind of prohibitive .
sd/2672_B	now , see that 's recycling , you know ,
sd/2672_B	companies that do at least go into it ,
sd/2672_B	i 'd like to see subsidy by the government or something , or taxwise or something , heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular .
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sd/2672_B	so that people would use this stuff re , over again .
b/2672_A	yeah ,
ba/2672_A	it 's a good idea .
sd/2672_B	it 's like when he was saying , uh , which one was recyclable , which was reusable ,
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sd/2672_B	and the recycle ones are better to use ,
sd/2672_B	but lots of times you do n't even see the signs on the bottles .
b/2672_A	yeah ,
ba/2672_A	true .
sv/2672_B	and if we 're going to really do something , they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it .
sd/2672_B	i had to put my bifocals on to see it .
%/2672_A	um .
sv/2672_B	that 's hard when you 're in a grocery store and you 're short anyway .
b/2672_A	yeah .
sv/2672_B	you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf .
sv/2672_B	you have n't got enough nerve to say well , put it back ,
^q/2672_B	it 's not recyclable .
sd/2672_A	i , i 'd heard something stranger ,
sd/2672_A	talk about bottles the other day on , uh , on the radio station , i think it 's k l t y. they were talking about the ,
sd/2672_A	i think it 's in canada they 're using , oh , recyclable milk jugs , plastic milk jugs ,
b/2672_B	uhhuh .
+/2672_A	as a , a reinforcement for roads .
bh/2672_B	oh , really ?
+/2672_A	for road repairs .
sd/2672_A	and apparently they , they do n't break down very easily ,
sd/2672_A	and ,
b/2672_B	oh .
+/2672_A	they do n't expand or , or contract when the weather changes ,
sd/2672_A	and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing .
%/2672_B	you know they 're ,
sd/2672_B	along that same line , they said they were using , um ,
^h/2672_B	what is , oh , i know ,
sd/2672_B	it was toilets . you know , the old ones ?
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
+/2672_B	smashing them up , because they 're , that stuff there is great for , in road work .
b/2672_A	huh .
sd/2672_B	and i thought , well , that 's good .
sd/2672_B	and then i saw recycling on tires between , uh ,
sd/2672_B	well , hoses were being used ,
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
+/2672_B	and , uh , uh , soaker hoses , made out of old tires .
b/2672_A	yeah .
%/2672_B	what else ,
^h/2672_B	something else was made out of old tires ,
^h/2672_B	i was trying to remember what it was . oh , i ca n't think of it now .
sd/2672_B	but i was , i was trying to get my , uh , kids , you know , to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes .
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sd/2672_B	and just anything , to , you know , recycle rather than keep throwing it away ,
sd/2672_B	but my biggest problem is , i take the bags out of the store , buy the bags to bring the back ,
sd/2672_B	and then i forget to bring them in the store .
b/2672_A	yeah .
sd/2672_B	i 'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out .
sd/2672_B	i wish they 'd really push this recycling bit , because i never realized , i really did n't realize how much stuff i actually throw away .
sv/2672_A	well , i think the , the more people are aware of it , the , the more they 'll do .
sv/2672_A	i think that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it in , in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is , and how important it is to do that .
sd/2672_B	you know what i 'd like to see a little more .
sd/2672_B	i do n't have any little tiny kids ,
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sv/2672_B	but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now ,
b/2672_A	yeah .
+/2672_B	in five years , when they get bigger , it 'll work a little bit more , too .
ba/2672_A	true .
%/2672_B	because it 's ,
sv/2672_B	we 've all got to do it right now .
%/2672_B	i just ,
sd/2672_B	i really amazed to find out that , what is it , eighty per cent are filled now , in , in garbage fills .
sd/2672_B	in five years we 're supposed to be at max .
b/2672_A	uhhuh .
sd/2672_B	i do n't think i can keep my own garbage .
sd/2672_B	i mean , i might not have that much ,
sd/2672_B	but i would n't ,
%/3023_A	i have , uh ,
sd/3023_A	i , well , i used to have the opinion that there wa , that there really was not any more crime in america , in the cities , anyway , than there was in previous centuries , uh , before , uh ,
%/3023_A	simply because .
sv/3023_A	the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced , uh , reporting methods , with computers and other devices .
bf/3023_B	compile more statistics .
aa/3023_A	that 's right ,
sv/3023_A	and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets .
b/3023_B	uhhuh .
sv/3023_A	however , i have been persuaded , lately , i guess , simply by the , uh , overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime .
aa/3023_B	more especially where you are .
qy/3023_B	are you ,
b/3023_A	well , yeah .
+/3023_B	in washington d c or washington state ?
nn/3023_A	no ,
sd/3023_A	i am in , i am in washington d c .
b/3023_B	yeah ,
b/3023_B	yeah ,
%/3023_B	i was going to say ,
%/3023_A	actually it ,
sd/3023_A	you know , i do a lot of business here ,
sd/3023_A	and i come here quite often
sd/3023_A	and , and that again is a , is a sort of media perception there 's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington .
b/3023_B	oh , yeah .
+/3023_A	regardless of the racial makeup ,
%/3023_A	but it 's , it 's real , uh ,
sd/3023_A	there 's pockets of violence that is so violent that they , uh ,
ba/3023_B	it just really grabs your attention .
aa/3023_A	yeah .
sv/3023_B	it just makes the whole place seem like that .
b/3023_A	right .
sd/3023_A	now just to focus on that a minute , i guess , uh , uh ,
sd/3023_A	when , uh , previous secretary of , uh , educa , bennett , i think his name was ,
b/3023_B	yeah .
+/3023_A	became the drug czar , uh , for , uh , president bush , he was going to focus on it , on this area and do something about it
sd/3023_A	and i see that even he was met without , with , with little success , even though the entire , i guess a , a quite a bit of money and other , uh , planning efforts went into that .
qo/3023_B	what do you , what do you think is causing all this ,
%/3023_A	well ,
%/3023_B	because , it seems that there
%/3023_B	even though
sv/3023_B	crime , though i think it is increasing in number , it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity ,
aa/3023_A	yes .
+/3023_B	and violence too .
sd/3023_A	well , i , i have three theories about it , you know , three things .
sd/3023_A	i have one theory ,
sd/3023_A	and it 's brought to us by two things .
sv/3023_A	one i , i believe that this is a function of , uh , the violence that young people see on television and the movies .
b/3023_B	uhhuh .
sd/3023_A	and , i am not just talking about , you know , uh , role models of gu , of tough guys and gangsters and things like that ,
sv/3023_A	i am not even , i am not even convinced that maybe things like football , hockey and , th , th , the , you know , the , and even baseball games now where the , everything is settled with a fight . you know , the , the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle th ,
+/3023_A	the argument .
sd/3023_A	and , and then i , i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree ,
%/3023_A	so i think that particularly
sd/3023_A	i , i was reading the other day about , uh , corpus christi , texas which has the the highest ,
sd/3023_A	i think it 's corpus christi , that had the highest rates per hand gun death in america
+/3023_A	uh , per capita .
b/3023_B	yeah ,
sd/3023_B	i was , i have not seen that ,
%/3023_B	but , uh ,
sd/3023_A	i mean the saturday night special stuff
%/3023_A	so ,
b/3023_B	yeah .
sd/3023_A	that , that 's what i think about it ,
sd/3023_A	that 's some of the things i think about it ,
sd/3023_A	plus i do not know ,
qo/3023_A	what are your views ?
b/3023_B	well , yeah ,
aa/3023_B	i tend to agree with you with , you know ,
sv/3023_B	it seems anymore , uh , a movie can not be considered good unless there 's just some , some sort of violence ,
aa/3023_A	yes .
+/3023_B	or something in it .
%/3023_B	and , and along with that , you know ,
sv/3023_B	and then you start making a movie and it has no , there 's no call for something violent ,
sv/3023_B	but , so they just throw something in there just to say they have it .
aa/3023_A	exac ,
aa/3023_A	well that 's , that 's , that 's the impression i get , you know .
b/3023_B	yeah .
sv/3023_A	and i , and i imagine that it 's , you know , it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society ,
%/3023_A	people want to ,
sv/3023_A	it conditions people to it
%/3023_A	and , uh , you have to amp ,
sv/3023_A	it has to be even , uh , magnified to to attract people 's attention . i guess ,
aa/3023_B	yeah ,
bf/3023_B	you become callous .
+/3023_A	to have them spend money on something like that .
b/3023_B	yeah .
sv/3023_A	and i am sure that it does form role models for young , for young men and young women
%/3023_A	and ,
b/3023_B	yeah .
sd/3023_A	uh , i mean i , i , read now where we are , you know ,
sd/3023_A	women are arr , young women are arrested fighting with knives over , over whatever .
b/3023_B	um .
+/3023_A	whatever reason , which is kind of unheard of when i was young .
arp_nd/3023_A	now , i do not want to sound like an old fart ,
%/3023_A	but ,
+/3023_A	that 's what
sv/3023_A	seems that those things happened befor , did not happen in that manner before television .
sv/3023_A	and i , i , i , i have to think that , that it has some influence on it .
%/3023_A	but ,
sd/3023_B	i listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time
b/3023_A	yeah .
qy^d/3023_B	i do not know if you listen to him or not ,
nn/3023_A	no .
sd/3023_B	he 's on a m ,
sd/3023_B	but , ther , there 's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the ,
sd/3023_B	there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles , the guy under gates ,
ny/3023_A	oh , yes .
sd/3023_B	and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was , just some of the things that he believed in , some of his morals .
sd/3023_B	for instance , uh , they asked him if he spanked his kids ,
sd/3023_B	and he said `` you bet , i believe in discipline '' .
sd/3023_B	and people , i , i , i , i guess they confus , confused discipline with punishment .
b/3023_A	yeah .
%/3023_B	you know .
b/3023_A	yeah .
%/3023_B	and , just ,
sv/3023_B	it seems anymore that , uh , if , if you have , you know , this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you .
sv/3023_B	it 's like , you know , hey , everybody has to be free to do their own thing .
ar/3023_B	and i disagree ,
sv/3023_B	and i think that 's really contributing to this high rate of crime .
aa/3023_A	yes ,
aa/3023_A	yes .
sv/3023_A	well , i mean , i , i guess what i wanted to say and i stopped , uh , i do not know , i got diverted , was that , that , uh , there 's so mu , there 's so much of a return from pris , to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure .
sv/3023_A	and , and that is not emphasized .
sd/3023_A	i recognize there 's , there 's over crowding problems
sv/3023_A	and , and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now , that that 's complicated the entire process .
b/3023_B	yeah .
%/3023_A	what i also think that ,
sv/3023_A	i guess it 's the reflection of the society where , where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to , uh ,
sv/3023_A	you know , it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you , where you live
sd/3023_A	or . i do not mean respons , attachment and responsibility ,
%/3023_A	i guess i mean any sort of ,
sv/3023_B	well , nobody feels responsibility to do something .
sv/3023_B	it 's like , oh boy , i wish they would stop doing that .
aa/3023_A	yes ,
aa/3023_A	that 's right .
b/3023_B	yeah .
b/3023_A	yeah
h/3023_A	i , i do not know how that 's ,
h/3023_A	i do not think it 's done by , uh ,
sv/3023_A	the changes come simply by statutory nature .
sd/3023_A	i do not know what it really will take .
b/3023_B	um .
sd/3023_A	and , i do not know if i have solutions , except , except to ,
sd/3023_A	you know , i am sort of a , a , an advocate of , of , uh , of letting people , of having free speech
%/3023_A	and i guess to curb , uh ,
sv/3023_A	television , uh , the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that .
b/3023_B	yeah .
%/3023_A	however , there does seem to be a ,
%/3023_A	right now in verbalizing ,
sv/3023_A	it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort .
b/3023_B	yeah ,
%/3023_B	and then how many ,
sv/3023_A	and the sacrifice is not that great .
qh/3023_B	how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between ,
b/3023_A	yeah .
+/3023_B	you know , what you see and how yo ,
sv/3023_B	i mean , what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do .
aa/3023_A	yes ,
aa/3023_A	yes ,
aa/3023_A	i think , i think that 's correct .
%/3023_B	and , yes
%/3023_B	but , you know , as soon as you start , uh ,
sd/3023_A	well , texas has , uh , texas has , uh , has always struck me ,
sd/3023_A	i mean i , i , i have lived in and out of texas , both in the service and , uh , uh , short business stints .
sv/3023_A	and it seems to me they are a pretty , pretty tough law and order state ,
%/3023_A	but that 's a ,
sv/3023_A	but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state .
%/3023_A	just citing that , you know .
b/3023_B	yeah ,
%/3023_B	uh , unfortunately you have got a lot of the , uh ,
sv/3023_B	some , well a lot of it can be contributed to th , the racial differences , i mean , just that we are so close ,
b/3023_A	yeah .
+/3023_B	to the border with mexico ,
sv/3023_B	we have got a lot of that influence .
b/3023_A	yeah .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2451_A	okay ,
sd/2451_A	this topic is , is russia a threat to our security ?
sv/2451_A	. i think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time .
qo/2451_A	, how do you feel about it ?
x/2451_A	.
sv/2451_B	well , they do have , uh , a major internal problem .
sv/2451_B	everybody wants to defect ,
sd/2451_B	and i can understand why .
sv/2451_B	um , i think their biggest problem is just , you know , obtaining food to live ,
sv/2451_B	so when you have the basic needs , uh ,
x/2451_A	.
+/2451_B	being unmet , i do n't think you think globally as far as , you know , being a threat to other people in the world .
x/2451_A	.
sv/2451_B	so , as soon as they get their , their own home country taken care of , then they 'll consider ,
x/2451_A	.
+/2451_B	what they can do with the rest of the world .
sv/2451_A	i believe communism is very much waning .
sv/2451_A	it 's , uh , pretty much on the way out of the door , insofar as the strong hold that they used to have ,
sv/2451_A	and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world ,
sv/2451_A	and their rebellions right now is the result of that .
sv/2451_A	if they can get the army ,
x/2451_B	.
+/2451_A	or the military to sway to their side , i think that , uh , it will be on the way out eventually .
sv/2451_A	it 's just a matter of time , because ,
x/2451_B	.
+/2451_A	in the baltic states they have already massacred so many people who protested ,
x/2451_B	.
sv/2451_A	and that has n't set too well with their diplomacy for the , regarding the , uh , outcome of their affairs .
qo/2451_A	what 's your synopsis ? .
sd/2451_B	well , i do , i do realize that , uh , uh , the bush administration is n't too happy with , with how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned .
sv/2451_B	i think it 's been a good , a good positive direction for uh , the soviets as far as yeltsin is concerned .
%/2451_B	you know , he was , uh , allowed to ,
%/2451_B	what , wh ,
sv/2451_B	in his , in the congress they , they gave him more power as far as his republic in russia is concerned , which is , gives him more power overall , which i think is a good sign that there will be some , you know ,
sv/2451_B	politically speaking , you know , he 's going to have more power ,
sv/2451_B	, and i think it 's a step in the right direction .
sv/2451_B	i think gorbachev realizes that he 's got a , a major uh , uh , power figure , you know , competing against him ,
sv/2451_B	and i think it 's going to be pretty close to his demise if he does n't follow suit with yeltsin as far as , uh , realizing ,
sv/2451_B	well , he does realize it , you know , with the fact that they reduced the uh , or they , increased the prices on their food , food and goods .
b/2451_A	uhhuh .
%/2451_B	uh .
sd/2451_A	i think that it went up a thousand percent on most ,
+/2451_B	it ,
b/2451_B	yeah .
sv/2451_B	tha , that 's incredible
sv/2451_B	but they had to , uh , go in the direction of a market driven economy ,
sv/2451_B	and , and they had to bite the bullet for that .
sv/2451_B	so that 's a good move , on , on gorbachev 's part in doing that .
b/2451_A	uhhuh .
%/2451_B	so ,
sv/2451_A	but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that ,
x/2451_B	.
+/2451_A	he 's moving towards a two to three party system of government that , nor eliminating or diminishing the communist power ,
sv/2451_A	and i guess that 's where yeltsin steps in , so far as his politics of government goes , uh ,
sd/2451_A	but i do n't know how convinced the people are of him yet , myself .
sv/2451_B	well , that 's all they got right now .
sv/2451_B	that 's their ray of hope .
b/2451_A	uhhuh .
sv/2451_B	so , you know , they 'll go with ,
x/2451_A	.
+/2451_B	you know , whoever comes through for them .
sv/2451_B	i , it , it 's just that ,
x/2451_A	.
+/2451_B	the weird thing is , is that gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates , as far as with glasnost and poistro , perestroika and stuff ,
sv/2451_B	and i think he 's got between the old guard and , , and the new , uh , glasnost .
sv/2451_B	uh , i think it 's kind of escalated to a point where it 's out of control .
b/2451_A	uhhuh .
sv/2451_B	and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on , peace on both sides .
sv/2451_B	so i think that 's where you know , , kind of where he 's stuck .
qy/2451_B	you know what i 'm saying ?
ny/2451_A	yeah .
sd/2451_A	uh , i understand .
sv/2451_B	and that 's the , that 's the situation that he finds himself in ,
sv/2451_B	and you know , he 's a tough guy ,
sv/2451_B	i mean , he 's been through it .
sd/2451_B	so i have no doubt that he 'll ,
sv/2451_B	i mean , i , i think overall he 's been a , a , good figure for the soviet union .
sv/2451_B	i mean , i think his intentions and his ideals are , are uh , well intentioned .
b/2451_A	uhhuh .
%/2451_B	and in the longterm ,
sv/2451_B	but i just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have ,
sv/2451_B	i think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him look , look worse that what his , um , what his ideals are ,
x/2451_A	.
+/2451_B	personally .
aa/2451_A	i agree .
sv/2451_A	what 's bad for the soviet system is that , they have the resources to grow and produce their food ,
sd/2451_A	but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should .
sv/2451_B	i think it 's , i think it 's a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it ? , bureaucracy and , and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption .
sv/2451_B	i think there 's a , a large amount of corruption on the , the have and the havenots .
aa/2451_A	yeah .
sv/2451_A	that 's probably more true than ,
+/2451_B	you know ,
sv/2451_B	i
+/2451_A	a lot of people realize .
+/2451_B	i know you 're going to have that with every society .
sv/2451_B	at least we 're more blatant about it ,
sv/2451_B	but it 's very secret ,
sv/2451_B	and it 's been going on for years .
sv/2451_B	i mean , you ca n't change things overnight .
b/2451_A	uhhuh .
sv/2451_B	and , but if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive , i mean , there 's revolution . you know ,
%/2451_B	and that 's ,
sv/2451_A	it seems to be headed in that direction too .
aa/2451_B	yeah ,
aa/2451_B	big time ,
aa/2451_B	major ,
sv/2451_B	but you know , that 's , that 's what happens when , you know , the cork blows
sv/2451_B	and you ca n't handle it anymore .
sv/2451_B	i mean , that 's
+/2451_B	that 's the way the world , uh , you know , revolves that way .
sv/2451_A	and uh , i think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things , too .
%/2451_A	they ,
sv/2451_A	probably not enough ,
sv/2451_A	but i 'm sure i lot of it 's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they 're missing out on .
b/2451_B	yeah ,
sv/2451_B	i think they 're starting to realize ,
sv/2451_B	but i , i just do n't think they have the resources , if you were to compare , uh , the americans to the soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines , fax machines and cellular phones , and state of the art equipment that we are so used to .
sv/2451_B	i do n't think they even realize what 's out there , and to what extent .
b/2451_A	yeah ,
sv/2451_A	i 'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items .
b/2451_B	yeah ,
sv/2451_B	the major conveniences of life .
b/2451_A	yeah
sv/2451_A	what we consider just , i do n't , normal everyday things to them is real luxury .
b/2451_B	yeah .
+/2451_A	which is unfortunate for them ,
sv/2451_A	and of course , most of us , we do n't really appreciate what we 've got because we 've been so used to it .
aa/2451_B	this is true .
aa/2451_B	this is very true .
%/2451_B	and we ,
sv/2451_B	it 's human , it 's human nature though to take things for granted
%/2451_B	and it kind of ,
x/2451_A	.
+/2451_B	you know ,
sv/2451_B	when you 've lost something or , or uh , uh , do n't have what other people have that 's when you tend to realize , you know , what 's out there and what , you know , what you have and what you do n't have .
aa/2451_A	yeah
aa/2451_A	i agree .
qy/2451_B	so the original question , do we think they 're a threat to our , you know , a security threat ?
ny/2451_A	yeah .
no/2451_B	um , yes and no .
aa/2451_A	yeah ,
sd/2451_A	i can go with that answer too .
sd/2451_A	the only yes i could go to is if uh , a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to , to a nuclear exchange ,
sv/2451_A	but i do n't even see that occurring .
aa/2451_B	um , no .
+/2451_A	uh , because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to i guess .
sv/2451_B	well , i do n't really feel that the soviets really want to blow up the world .
sv/2451_B	i mean , um , we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as , as nonfeeling machine type people ,
sv/2451_B	and they 're people just like us .
sv/2451_B	i mean
b/2451_A	uhhuh .
+/2451_B	you know , they get up everyday ,
sv/2451_B	and they put their pants on the same way ,
sv/2451_B	and they have to eat and everything else ,
sv/2451_B	and i just do n't feel that ...
x/4382_B	.
sd/4382_A	well , here in logan , utah , we 've got a nice little valley here
sd/4382_A	and it 's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in
sd/4382_A	and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley .
%/4382_B	huh .
sd/4382_B	well , here in seattle , uh , it 's g , the air 's getting more and more polluted .
sd/4382_B	we 're , uh , we 're in kind of a basin .
sd/4382_B	and , uh , seattle is on puget sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains .
sd/4382_B	and , uh , there 's been a lot , a lot of growth , population growth around here .
sv/4382_B	and , uh , it 's , uh , it 's getting worse .
sv/4382_B	i think
b/4382_A	yeah .
+/4382_B	most of it is from cars .
aa/4382_A	yeah .
aa/4382_A	definitely .
sd/4382_A	here in utah up along the wasatch along the western side of the , of these rocky mountains here , where a lot of the big cities are salt lake and ogden and provo
sd/4382_A	and logan 's up in the valley a little bit further north ,
sd/4382_A	we get a lot of pollution
sd/4382_A	and it 's like seventy percent of it is from cars .
b/4382_B	uhhuh .
sd/4382_A	and , uh , it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion .
sd/4382_A	and when we get ,
x/4382_B	.
+/4382_A	get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above
sd/4382_A	and it just sits and sits and sits
sd/4382_A	and we 're starting to hit pollution levels now on the wasatch front which match that of l a a few years ago .
b/4382_B	oh .
sv/4382_A	it 's not , it 's almost sad .
sd/4382_A	because when i grew up here , it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys
sd/4382_A	and now it 's not in the mountain valleys .
b/4382_B	yeah .
b/4382_B	yeah ,
sd/4382_B	i live in the ,
x/4382_A	.
+/4382_B	university district
sv/4382_B	and , uh , uh , it 's supposed to have about the worst air pollution .
sv/4382_B	i think probably due to , uh , a lot of students going back and forth to school .
%/4382_A	huh .
sd/4382_B	and then we 're right next to interstate five also .
sd/4382_A	they 're getting serious about things like , uh , mandatory ,
sd/4382_A	well they 've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you 're in certain counties ,
sd/4382_A	emissions .
b/4382_B	oh , yeah .
qy/4382_B	have they started doing that yet ?
ny/4382_A	yeah .
sd/4382_A	they 've actually started doing it down along the ,
sd/4382_A	not in logan up here cause we 're doing a lot better .
sd/4382_A	we have a lot , population is a lot lighter up here .
sd/4382_B	we have that here
sd/4382_B	and , uh , they 're , they 're expanding it to , uh , more counties here . uh , as the population spreads out
sv/4382_B	and i think they 're also going to be making it , uh , mandatory for more cars .
sd/4382_B	th , th , there was , uh , something in the law about if your car was over a certain age , like over twenty years old , you did n't have to get it done anymore .
sv/4382_B	and
b/4382_A	yeah .
+/4382_B	i think they 're eliminating that , uh
b/4382_A	yeah .
sd/4382_A	they 're ge , eliminating that out here .
+/4382_B	that loophole .
b/4382_B	yeah .
sd/4382_A	they 're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun . where they 're , uh , looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the , basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust .
sd/4382_A	kind of like a radar gun .
%/4382_A	and ...
b/4382_B	oh , really ,
qy/4382_B	you mean they could
ny/4382_A	yes .
+/4382_B	do that remotely ?
ny/4382_A	yeah .
sd/4382_A	do it remotely just looking at the , what they do ,
sd/4382_A	they do several different types of things .
sd/4382_A	sometimes they put a source light
sd/4382_A	and they look at the source light
sd/4382_A	and then as the car goes by , you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it
sd/4382_A	and you can look at the emissions actually .
%/4382_B	huh .
%/4382_A	and ...
qw/4382_B	now where does the source light go ?
sd/4382_A	like across the street .
sd/4382_A	they 'll set up
bk/4382_B	oh , i see .
+/4382_A	like a trap or something like that in some sense .
sd/4382_A	and they 're also looking at , uh , other , you know , ways of monitoring this and , cause they 've found out something basically that , uh ,
sd/4382_A	and a poorly tuned car can emit something ,
sd/4382_A	it 's an incredible amount .
sd/4382_A	it was like four hundred times as much
ba/4382_B	jeez .
+/4382_A	uh , of certain pollutants , and it was like unburned hydrocarbons , then a properly tuned car .
sd/4382_A	and , and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars , well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the , the pollution then , you know , you , it 'd be one way to cut the pollution in half .
b/4382_B	yeah .
ba/4382_B	that 's neat .
x/4382_A	.
%/4382_B	but it 's also been , uh , oh , you know ,
sd/4382_B	everybody is talking about using more mass transient here
sv/4382_B	but it , uh , it 's tough , you know .
sd/4382_B	like i 've , i 've looked into riding the bus to work
sd/4382_B	and i can drive to work in , uh , and get there in twenty to twentyfive minutes over a very congested corridor . which goes over lake washington on one of the floating bridges .
b/4382_A	uhhuh .
sd/4382_B	but if i , uh , if i take the bus , it requires several transfers
sd/4382_B	and it takes over an hour .
%/4382_A	huh .
sv/4382_B	so so it
b/4382_A	yeah .
%/4382_A	and they 're ...
+/4382_B	it 's , it 's not hard to see why , why i keep driving .
sd/4382_B	and you know , i feel guilty cause i 'm driving a ,
qw/4155_A	um , what 's our topic ?
sd/4155_B	taxes .
sd/4155_A	taxes .
qy/4155_B	do we pay too much ?
b/4155_A	right .
b/4155_A	right .
%/4155_A	um ,
qy/4155_B	well , do we ?
qw/4155_A	what do you do ?
%/4155_B	um ,
sv/4155_A	i guess that ,
sv/4155_A	i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you 're in .
sd/4155_B	my tax bracket is , is pretty high up there .
sd/4155_B	i pay the , i generally pay the maximum tax bracket .
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
sv/4155_B	and , uh , i think that we 're paying too much
sd/4155_B	because i do n't have any children .
b/4155_A	right .
sd/4155_B	and i pay a lot of property taxes .
b/4155_A	oh , sure .
sd/4155_B	i do n't have any , um , i do n't , you know , i do n't use an awful lot of city services .
sv/4155_B	it , it , you know
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
+/4155_B	it 's like i have to work m , i have to work all the time
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
+/4155_B	just to make enough money to pay the taxes .
b/4155_A	right .
sd/4155_B	and , um , y , there 's so many people who want a , a dib of the federal money
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
+/4155_B	or the state money or whatever it is
%/4155_B	and i just ,
sd/4155_B	sometimes , many times i end up feeling like i 'm paying too much in taxes .
b/4155_A	right .
qo/4155_B	how about you ?
qy/4155_B	do you pay too much ?
nn/4155_A	uh , well , no ,
sv/4155_A	i ca n't really complain .
sd/4155_A	i 'm a student , um ,
sd/4155_A	and i d , i work as a coop at , uh , georgia tech research institute .
sd/4155_A	and , uh , i 'm going to get back most of what i earned , i mean most of what i pay in taxes
sd/4155_A	and , uh , and , uh ,
sv/4155_B	well , when you
+/4155_A	on , one of my parents is still claiming me .
br/4155_A	huh ?
+/4155_B	when you go out into the , uh , when you go out into the working world
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
+/4155_B	it , it changes quickly .
aa/4155_A	i 'm sure .
sd/4155_B	um , you look at your paycheck
sd/4155_B	and you go , oh , my gosh where did it all go .
x/4155_A	.
qw/4155_B	um , what kind of , what kind of ,
%/4155_B	uh , well have you pay a lot of in ta ,
qy/4155_B	have you been out working and then gone back to school
qrr/4155_B	or are you , did you go directly from high school into , into college ?
sd/4155_A	i went ,
sd/4155_A	well i did work , um , just very for some time
sd/4155_A	but i did n't make enough money to really make ,
^2/4155_B	to worry about it .
+/4155_A	too much of a difference .
aa/4155_A	right .
qy/4155_B	have you , have you been active in , in politics trying to , concerning this ?
qy/4155_B	have you like worked on political action committees or something like that ?
nn/4155_A	no ,
nn/4155_A	no ,
sd/4155_A	i have n't .
sd/4155_B	i , uh , i have n't done any of that type of work myself .
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
sd/4155_B	um , but every once in a while when i hear up here at , at , uh , in d c area , um , one of the radio stations has been talking about the , the congress ,
sd/4155_B	um , congress has added too towards the members bank there , you know ,
sd/4155_B	there 's a bank that they all bank with ,
sd/4155_B	and i guess it went defunct recently .
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
sd/4155_B	and one of the congressmen has , has written in the last three years al , about a thousand bad checks .
%/4155_A	huh .
sd/4155_B	and we , we the taxpayers float him a loan for all tho , all those bad checks ,
b/4155_A	oh .
+/4155_B	no interest , no repayment schedule .
bh/4155_A	really ?
sd/4155_B	and , um , it 's causing quite a stir up here ,
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
+/4155_B	because we 're so close to d c anyway .
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
sv/4155_B	it 's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur .
ba/4155_A	oh , sure .
sv/4155_B	um , i , i , i think we pay too much .
sd/4155_B	and i 've , i look at my paycheck
sd/4155_B	and i make ,
^h/4155_B	well , let 's see .
sd/4155_B	they take out in state and federal taxes
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
sv/4155_B	i think i pay fortytwo percent .
ba/4155_A	wow .
sd/4155_B	fortytwo cents out of every dollar i make goes to the government ,
x/4155_A	.
sd/4155_B	and then they charge me sales tax
sd/4155_B	and they charge me gasoline taxes ,
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
%/4155_A	taxes .
sd/4155_B	and they charge me all these others ,
sv/4155_B	and it 's just too expensive .
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
sd/4155_B	i ca n't believe that
sd/4155_B	i , i 'm just thankful that i do n't get all the government that i pay for .
%/4155_A	huh .
qy/4155_B	you know what i mean ?
ny/4155_A	yeah .
qy/4155_B	do you , have you used , um , student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government ?
nn/4155_A	no ,
nn/4155_A	no ,
sd/4155_A	i have n't .
sd/4155_A	uh , i , uh , my father pays for my , my schooling , my tuition .
sd/4155_A	so , uh , i 'm , i have n't made use of that .
qw/4155_B	what are you studying down there ?
sd/4155_A	physics .
b^m/4155_B	physics .
aa/4155_A	uhhuh .
sv/4155_B	oh , that sounds like a fun , fun field .
sd/4155_A	everybody says that .
sd/4155_B	scientific .
br/4155_A	huh .
sd/4155_B	heavy science .
x/4155_A	.
qy/4155_B	are you like in the particle , particle research or anything like that
qrr/4155_B	or is it more , um , applied physics ?
sd/4155_A	um , i have n't , i have n't gotten too terribly much into my major yet .
sd/4155_A	actually , um , the , the degree i 'm getting is physics .
sd/4155_A	there 's a different one for applied physics
sd/4155_A	so i guess you could call it more straight stuff
bk/4155_B	okay .
+/4155_A	than applied .
sd/4155_B	well maybe , maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that 's ,
x/4155_A	.
+/4155_B	come rolling towards , whatever it 's rolling toward .
sv/4155_A	i doubt about that .
qy/4155_A	are , are , is america , i mean are we pretty , pretty steep compared to most countries ?
ng/4155_B	actually , i do n't think we are .
aa/4155_A	no ,
sd/4155_A	i do n't think so either .
sd/4155_B	um , like , like europe ,
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
+/4155_B	um , england .
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
+/4155_B	i know the taxes are a lot higher .
b/4155_A	uhhuh .
sd/4155_B	but they do have socialized medicine and things like that .
b/4155_A	yeah .
sd/4155_B	and , um , i know i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that , um , they 're talking ,
sd/4155_B	or maybe it was on the radi ,
ad/2467_A	so , uh , describe your family budget .
sd/2467_B	well , i 've , uh , for a lot of years i , i 've pretty much flied without one ,
sd/2467_B	and , uh , just recently , uh , we , we set up a budget ,
sd/2467_B	and , and we 're trying to stick to it .
sd/2467_B	we just bought a new house .
sd/2467_B	so we 've got everything , you know , pretty much we know what our , uh , our fixed expenses are per month ,
sd/2467_B	and then we 've got some ones that are variable , that pretty much stay within a certain range ,
sd/2467_B	and then , uh , then there 's the ones that you never know anything about ,
sd/2467_B	and that 's , that 's the food
aa/2467_A	well , yeah ,
sv/2467_A	and to some extent , utilities , i imagine .
ar/2467_B	well , the utilities are pretty much ,
sv/2467_B	you can pretty much figure what they 're going to be ,
sd/2467_B	and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they 'll average them out for you .
sd/2467_A	they have that to some extent here ,
sd/2467_A	but it 's not quite as good .
b/2467_B	uhhuh .
sd/2467_A	and , uh , transportation expenses ,
qy^d/2467_A	i guess you own a car .
ny/2467_B	yes
sd/2467_B	sir .
qy/2467_A	and you know how much you 're going to drive every week ?
no/2467_B	well , i used to , um , i used to know , uh , fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove , because i , i was very convenient , i lived , uh , nine tenths of a mile from work .
b/2467_A	huh .
sd/2467_B	so , so , it was , you know , two miles a day to and from work .
sd/2467_B	so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot .
sd/2467_B	but now i 've just bought a new house ,
sd/2467_B	and i 'm a half hour ,
sd/2467_B	and so my transportation costs have gone up by , uh , five times .
b/2467_A	yeah ,
ba/2467_A	i understand that .
sd/2467_A	we , we have a real similar situation .
sd/2467_A	ours , uh , have quintupled , at least .
sd/2467_A	so there is a real family budget .
aa/2467_B	yeah ,
aa/2467_B	pretty much , um .
sd/2467_B	the problem is there never seems to be enough money .
sd/2467_B	i have three children ,
sv/2467_B	and it seems like the more money you make , the more money you have , the more things that they seem to need ,
sv/2467_B	and , uh , of course , nothing ever goes down ,
%/2467_B	i mean , uh , i remember ,
sd/2467_B	i have five children total .
sd/2467_B	i have three left in the house .
b/2467_A	yeah .
sd/2467_B	and i can remember years ago , when school would start ,
sd/2467_B	and i 'd go buy all five kids , you know , shoes ,
sd/2467_B	and i could get out of the , out of the shoe store without spending more than thirtyfive dollars .
sv/2467_B	nowadays , thirtyfive dollars buys about one pair of shoes
sv/2467_A	if you 're lucky .
aa/2467_B	yeah ,
sv/2467_B	so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last , uh , i guess about the last ten years .
qy/2467_A	exempt or nonexempt .
sd/2467_B	i 'm exempt .
ba/2467_A	wow ,
ba/2467_A	must be nice .
x/2467_B	.
sd/2467_A	part of the high price spread . uh ,
ar/2467_A	no ,
sd/2467_A	well , we do n't , we do ,
sd/2467_A	but we do n't have a family budget .
sd/2467_A	we have the fixed things we have to pay .
b/2467_B	uhhuh .
sd/2467_A	and we have the things that are extras .
sd/2467_A	but it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist .
b/2467_B	yeah .
sd/2467_A	and , well , you know , the auto budget ,
sd/2467_A	car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry .
b/2467_B	uhhuh .
sv/2467_A	and insurance ,
qy/2467_A	is insurance bad there ?
sd/2467_B	um , i 've got , uh , two older cars .
%/2467_B	there both ,
sd/2467_B	one 's a seventyseven
sd/2467_B	and one 's a seventyeight .
sd/2467_A	well , we 've got one eightynine .
sd/2467_B	and my insurance is about , it was running about four hundred dollars a year .
sd/2467_B	but when i moved to the new town i live in ,
sd/2467_B	because it 's a different county , which has less crime , and , uh , less , you know , less highways
sd/2467_B	and so it 's a cheaper place to live , as far as the insurance company 's concerned ,
sd/2467_B	so my , my , i think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year .
ba/2467_A	wow .
ba/2467_A	that 's not bad ,
bf/2467_A	four hundred and something a year .
%/2467_A	that 's , that 's ,
ar/2467_B	it 's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars .
sd/2467_A	that 's cheaper than we pay .
b/2467_B	yeah ,
sd/2467_B	i was down in texas for two years ,
sd/2467_B	and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance . um ,
sd/2467_A	well , here in colorado it 's even worse because we have no fault .
b/2467_B	yeah .
qy/2467_A	do you have that there ?
sd/2467_B	they have no fault in maryland also .
sd/2467_A	well , no fault 's rather funny in colorado , because it seems that everyone pays all the time
b/2467_B	yeah .
+/2467_A	instead of just the guilty party pays .
b/2467_B	uhhuh .
b/2467_B	yeah .
x/2467_A	.
sd/2467_B	it 's kind of , it 's kind of strange here the way things go . uh ,
sd/2467_B	here if you have an accident and no one 's injured , the police wo n't even show up .
bh/2467_A	you 're kidding .
nn/2467_B	nope .
sd/2467_B	they say if nobody 's injured , you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company .
ba/2467_A	god .
%/2467_B	well , if you ,
qw^d/2467_B	i do n't know how familiar you are with maryland ,
%/2467_B	but , uh ,
sd/2467_A	not at all .
sd/2467_B	especially , the center part of maryland where i ninetyfive runs through it is really heavily populated .
sd/2467_B	there 's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it 'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic .
qy^d/2467_A	they do n't even try to keep up with it .
nn/2467_B	no .
ba/2467_A	god .
sd/2467_B	not a bit .
qy/2467_A	so you lived in texas for a while .
ny/2467_B	yes
sd/2467_B	sir .
b/2467_A	huh .
sd/2467_B	i spent , uh , couple of years down there .
sd/2467_B	moved down there in eightyseven
sd/2467_B	and moved out in eightynine .
qw/2467_A	are , where you from originally .
sd/2467_B	uh , right here in maryland .
b/2467_A	huh ,
bf/2467_A	so you just basically went home when you had a chance .
aa/2467_B	yeah ,
sd/2467_B	my family , uh , did n't like texas ,
sd/2467_B	and i had a chance to , uh , transfer up .
sd/2467_B	t i bought a company about seven months after i moved to texas , right here in .
ba/2467_A	that 's nice .
sd/2467_B	so i got an opportunity to transfer back ,
sd/2467_B	and i took it .
ba/2467_A	god ,
ba/2467_A	that 's great .
sd/2467_A	uh , i 'm a native texan .
b/2467_B	uhhuh .
sd/2467_A	west texan .
b/2467_B	yeah .
sv/2467_A	there is a difference .
aa/2467_B	yeah ,
ad/2467_B	believe me ,
aa/2467_B	i know there is .
sd/2467_B	i lived in plano ,
qy^d/2467_B	and i do n't know if you 're familiar with plano
ny/2467_A	yeah .
sd/2467_B	but plano , maybe five percent of the plano actually were from texas .
sd/2467_B	everybody else was an import .
sd/2467_A	well , i 'm a west texan .
b/2467_B	uhhuh .
sd/2467_A	lubbock , midland odessa
b/2467_B	yes .
+/2467_A	amarillo , dumas , panhandle .
b/2467_B	yeah .
sv/2467_A	a different world from down there .
b/2467_B	yeah .
sd/2467_A	so , uh , colorado 's been fun .
sd/2467_A	but they have a real problem .
sd/2467_A	next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile .
sd/2467_A	and every time you look at a , look at the mountains
b/2467_B	yeah .
+/2467_A	or think about looking at the mountains , you got to throw in a dollar .
x/2467_B	.
sd/2467_A	or so it seems .
sd/2467_A	i may just be paranoid ,
sd/2467_A	but that state income tax is just eating me alive .
b/2467_B	yeah ,
b/2467_B	yeah ,
sd/2467_B	they have a state income tax in maryland .
sd/2467_B	but i noticed when i was in the , in the , in texas , they did n't have a state income tax ,
sv/2467_B	but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and ,
aa/2467_A	yeah ,
aa/2467_A	yeah .
+/2467_B	school taxes and property taxes ,
aa/2467_A	property taxes and ,
ba/2467_B	oh my god ,
sv/2467_B	ate you alive .
aa/2467_A	yeah ,
sd/2467_A	well , colorado , ins , you know they have the state income tax ,
sd/2467_A	but then they also have property taxes ,
sd/2467_A	and they also have sales taxes ,
sd/2467_A	and they just get you every direction they can .
b/2467_B	yeah .
h/2467_A	and i just do n't know , sir ,
sv/2467_A	but it seems like they trying to get you every which way .
aa/2467_B	yeah ,
aa/2467_B	it sure does . um ,
sd/2467_B	there 's , uh , some good books that i 've read , um , that you might be interested in . uh
bh/2467_A	oh yeah ?
sd/2467_B	charles d. gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night t v
sd/2467_B	and he 's got seminars you can go to ,
sd/2467_B	and they try to hook you into his organization , which costs about four hundred bucks .
sd/2467_B	but he 's got a couple of books out .
sd/2467_B	one of them is called , uh , wealth without risk .
sd/2467_A	i 've heard of the book .
b/2467_B	yes ,
sv/2467_B	it 's a very good book .
sd/2467_B	it 's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then
qy/2467_A	legally ?
+/2467_B	what to do with the money that you save .
qy^d/2467_A	legally ,
ny/2467_B	yes ,
ny/2467_B	yes ,
+/2467_A	cut money on your taxes .
b/2467_A	huh .
sd/2467_B	legally , legally cut money on your taxes , and on your insurance ,
sd/2467_B	and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to , uh , you know , be wealthier . uh ,
sd/2467_B	he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and have n't had a chance to crack it open yet . um ,
sd/2467_B	financial self defense is the name of it . uh ,
sd/2467_B	the man , uh , has a lot of good ideas ,
sd/2467_B	some of them i already knew about ,
sd/2467_B	some of them i had already practiced .
sd/2467_B	but i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because , uh ,
qy^d/2467_A	and that includes everyone at t i .
ny/2467_B	yes ,
sd/2467_B	i 'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninetyone .
ny/2467_B	yes .
sd/2467_A	well , even , the , you know , the nonexempts , technically yet we have n't had our salary frozen yet .
b^m/2467_B	yet .
sv/2467_A	but when you 're only at living wage it does n't matter .
x/2467_B	.
sv/2467_A	you know , survival is a funny state .
aa/2467_B	yeah ,
ba/2467_B	i know what you mean .
sd/2467_B	i , uh , when i was in dallas i was supervisor ,
sd/2467_B	and i had four non exempts , um , under me .
b/2467_A	yeah .
sd/2467_B	and , uh , i was appalled at what , how they were paying them .
sd/2467_B	i just could n't believe it .
sd/2467_A	did , well , i 've been with the company for sixteen years now .
sd/2467_A	i was a w f for several years ,
sv/2467_A	and it just n , never seems to improve .
sv/2467_A	it , and it does n't seem to get much better for the exempts either , unless you 're twentyeight or above .
aa/2467_B	yeah ,
aa/2467_B	yeah .
sv/2467_A	it 's really a shame .
sd/2467_B	well , i , i 've , this company that they bought , they ended up buying a very high payroll .
b/2467_A	oh .
sd/2467_B	and , uh , the , you know , i thought i was making a good wage ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/3198_A	okay .
qy/3198_A	did you want me to go ahead ?
aa/3198_B	i 'll let you go ahead and start , yeah .
bk/3198_A	okay .
%/3198_A	well , one thing ,
sv/3198_A	i , i guess both of us are very much aware of the equality .
sv/3198_A	uh , it seems like women are , uh , just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in , uh , jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did .
sv/3198_A	uh , it 's not uncommon to see men doing dishes , making supper , or taking care of the kids
%/3198_A	or som , uh ,
sd/3198_A	the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which , uh , they did everything .
sd/3198_A	they went to work
sd/3198_A	and they took care of the family ,
%/3198_A	so .
aa/3198_A	exactly .
aa/3198_A	exactly .
b/3198_A	yeah .
+/3198_B	of that kind of stuff
sd/3198_B	but my husband is wonderful .
b/3198_A	yeah ,
sd/3198_A	that 's the way my husband is too .
sd/3198_A	i mean it , it does n't , uh , does n't bother him at all to do the dishes .
b/3198_B	yeah .
sd/3198_A	it does n't bother h , him at all to do the laundry verses , uh , men from way back .
%/3198_A	there is that ,
sv/3198_A	well , if you did that you were henpecked or whatever .
sv/3198_A	but ,
b/3198_B	yeah ,
b/3198_B	yeah .
+/3198_A	men are starting ,
sv/3198_B	there are still some that are n't cooperating
%/3198_B	but ,
b/3198_A	yeah ,
sv/3198_A	those are very few .
sv/3198_A	i think those men do n't last very long in relationships because i think women know what they want .
sv/3198_B	they 're not accepting that anymore .
b/3198_A	right ,
aa/3198_A	exactly .
b/3198_B	yeah .
sv/3198_A	and it 's , it 's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything , uh , you know , and then kind of real light pay .
sv/3198_A	there 's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all .
sv/3198_A	so it 's , it 's kind of a , uh , neat thing to see as far as equality in the households ,
sv/3198_A	and i think that 's even going to get better . even , you know ,
b/3198_B	yeah .
+/3198_A	even more so .
sv/3198_A	i think it 's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it wo n't be your job description instead of your role definition is this .
%/3198_A	it will be , uh ,
sd/3198_A	hopefully for my daughter who i instill into , it does n't matter if you want to drive a truck , honey ,
sd/3198_A	or it does n't matter if you want to be a nurse ,
sd/3198_A	it does n't matter if you want to be , uh , the president ,
sd/3198_A	or it does n't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor ,
sd/3198_A	it does n't matter .
sd/3198_A	it 's what you want to be .
sd/3198_A	so i have always instilled into her ,
sd/3198_A	and i think mothers , um , are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say , hey , you do n't have to stay with nursing ,
sd/3198_A	you do n't have to be a secretary ,
sd/3198_A	you do n't have to be ,
b/3198_B	yeah .
%/3198_A	so .
b/3198_B	yeah .
sv/3198_B	well , i feel like , um , to an extent that is really important ,
b/3198_A	uhhuh .
+/3198_B	you know , that , that , um , it is important for women who need to work
b/3198_A	uhhuh .
+/3198_B	uh , or are in a position that they want to
^2/3198_A	if they want to , right .
+/3198_B	that they can do that .
b/3198_A	uhhuh .
sv/3198_B	um , but i also think it is important for them to be with the children .
aa/3198_A	i do too .
sv/3198_B	i ,
sd/3198_A	you know , there 's a certain part of me ,
+/3198_B	i think there , there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men .
b/3198_A	uhhuh .
sv/3198_B	and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women .
b/3198_A	yeah .
sv/3198_B	i do n't think it should ever be totally equal .
b/3198_A	yeah .
%/3198_B	you know that 's not , uh ,
sv/3198_B	we 're not made like that .
sv/3198_A	well , emotionally i think , uh ,
ba/3198_B	that 's right .
+/3198_A	women do a little bit , uh ,
sv/3198_A	i , i think that 's , the gap is coming closer a , as , um , what i 've learned in , uh , just , just being out there .
sv/3198_A	it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men 's gatherings ,
sv/3198_A	and they get together
sv/3198_A	and they talk about issues of marriage , talk about manhood , talk about what they did n't have with their fathers .
b/3198_B	huh .
sv/3198_A	are expressing more emotions , learning what emotions are .
sv/3198_A	it may be in the future that men , you know , some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves .
sv/3198_A	um
b/3198_B	yeah .
+/3198_A	i , i know of some mothers that i , i guess i 'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding , more , um , low key , more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised , you know , to develop whatever skills that they have ,
sv/3198_A	and some of the men are developing , uh , very good too .
sv/3198_A	so ,
b/3198_B	yeah .
+/3198_A	it may come down to where it 's , it 's individual basis . where everybody is treated an as individual ,
b/3198_B	yeah .
+/3198_A	and not by sex .
sd/3198_A	if you want to stay home and take care of the kids , honey , that 's fine .
sd/3198_A	i will go out and make the , uh , take care of the , uh , money making .
sv/3198_A	and it , it would n't matter if it 's a woman or a man saying that .
sv/3198_B	one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that , and for some it 's not a problem , but there 's more and more , it 's difficult for a family to make a living on one
^2/3198_A	on one income ,
b/3198_A	uhhuh .
+/3198_B	income .
sv/3198_B	it can be done ,
b/3198_A	yeah .
sv/3198_B	but you make sacrifices .
b/3198_A	yeah ,
%/3198_A	that ,
%/3198_B	you know , and , and it 's , um ,
sd/3198_A	kind of like what , uh , my husband and myself are doing right now .
sd/3198_A	my daughter 's three , even though at this current time she 's ready to get involved with ,
sd/3198_A	she 's an only child .
sd/3198_A	i do n't know ,
b/3198_B	yeah .
+/3198_A	if you 've only got one ,
qw/2723_A	about how many calls have you made on this system ?
sd/2723_B	uh , i 've originated only a , a few .
bk/2723_A	oh , okay ,
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	but i 've received quite a few .
sd/2723_A	i , uh , i only started doing it after , uh , i started getting calls and said , oh , heck ,
ba/2723_A	that 's right ,

sv/2723_B	and , uh , it 's hard to beat any of the benefits that , or salaries either ,
b/2723_A	uhhuh .
+/2723_B	that we get from t i .
sd/2723_B	i 'm quite pleased with it .
sv/2723_B	course there 's a few things that , uh , i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the c e o 's seat
sv/2723_B	but , uh
b/2723_A	oh , yeah .
+/2723_B	i think jerry 's doing a pretty good job as it goes .
%/2723_A	the one ,
%/2723_A	it 's kind of like , uh ,
sd/2723_A	automobile insurance ,
sd/2723_A	the ones , uh , that i think are the highest and important to me , uh , i hope i never have to use them , really per se , although i 've used medical a little bit
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
sv/2723_A	that , well that one certainly is high ,
sd/2723_A	i , i worry that it 's weakening rather than strengthening
sd/2723_A	so i like to reverse that trend and say i 'd like to get those to strengthen , you know ,
x/2723_B	.
+/2723_A	be better and better .
%/2723_B	well ,
sd/2723_A	then sal , sal , salary continuance , i 've never used that one .
sd/2723_A	i hope i never will ,
sd/2723_A	but that 's kind of like an insurance thing .
sv/2723_A	i sure like that one .
b/2723_B	oh , yes .
sv/2723_A	that 's like automobile insurance .
sv/2723_A	you never want to get in an accident
%/2723_A	but it ,
sd/2723_A	you like to have it there .
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
sd/2723_B	well , uh , like i say , i worked for several different companies
sv/2723_B	and there 's nothing to compare with , uh , t i here .
b/2723_A	uhhuh .
sd/2723_B	now i really got caught up back in eightyfive ,
sd/2723_B	i got caught up in the oil layoff , uh ,
sd/2723_B	i was n't with g s i , but i was connected with , uh , uh , oil , uh ,
b/2723_A	right .
+/2723_B	exploration .
qy/2723_A	with t i , or somebody else ?
nn/2723_B	no ,
sd/2723_B	with t i .
b/2723_A	uhhuh .
sd/2723_B	but i say , i was n't connected with g s i .
b/2723_A	oh , right ,
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	and , i got caught up in a layoff .
%/2723_A	um .
sd/2723_B	now , uh , course you get six months , uh , unemployment from the state
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	but , what t i did for us is , is , uh , i 've never heard of it before . they fixed us up with an office with , uh , telephones , access to longdistance , uh , computers , a secretary to take messages for us or type , uh , letters ,
b/2723_A	right .
+/2723_B	for us .
sd/2723_B	uh , they had out of town newspapers
%/2723_B	and then ,
^2/2723_A	and outside consultants .
qy/2723_A	did n't they have an outside consultant , too ?
br/2723_B	i beg your pardon .
qy/2723_A	did they have an outside consultant , like a , the employ ,
ny/2723_B	uh , yes .
sd/2723_B	they did have , uh , seminars every once in a while .
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	uh , course that was not , uh , restricted just to just us .
b/2723_A	right .
sd/2723_B	but the most important thing was that , uh , they had made up the difference between , uh , unemployment pay and seventyfive percent of my net pay .
%/2723_B	and they then ,
sd/2723_B	t i paid me that .
bh/2723_A	oh , really ?
sd/2723_B	so , uh , i was able to , uh , not just exist .
sd/2723_B	i mean , i , i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off .
b/2723_A	yeah ,
sv/2723_A	they seem to be do , doing a good job of that .
sd/2723_A	i 'm in facilities ,
sd/2723_A	and our organization built , builds those facilities over in park central now .
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
sd/2723_A	and i guess they 've been using them for six months now .
sd/2723_A	and i 've known several engineers that got laid off
sd/2723_A	and they said it 's like getting a ph d almost ,
%/2723_A	they ,
sd/2723_A	the much they learn over there , you know , after they 've been laid off , uh ,
sd/2723_A	one engineer said it was really an education .
sd/2723_A	he , he just learned , like you ,
sd/2723_A	he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own .
sd/2723_A	he was very thankful for that , too .
sd/2723_B	well , this was not a learning thing by any means .
sd/2723_B	it was just a , uh ,
^2/2723_A	to have an office ,
b/2723_A	yeah .
+/2723_B	an assistance trying to find another job .
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_A	well , he said he learned so much
%/2723_A	and how ,
sd/2723_A	he thought , he thought he had a ph d in how to get a job after he was ,
b/2723_B	oh .
+/2723_A	through the whole process ,
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
+/2723_A	for , for several months .
sd/2723_A	he did eventually get a job .
sd/2723_B	well , course i went through this , uh , what , about five years ago .
sd/2723_B	they may have improved it considerably .
b/2723_A	yeah , apparently .
sv/2723_A	it 's very sophisticated .
sv/2723_A	and i guess it may be one of the best , uh , that anyone 's doing .
sd/2723_B	well , that 's one of those little , uh , uh , little extras that you do n't see in the , uh , the , the , the handbook , you know .
b/2723_A	right .
ba/2723_A	you 're absolutely right .
ba/2723_A	that 's a good one .
%/2723_B	it ,
qo/2723_A	what do you think about pensions ?
%/2723_A	anything on that or ,
%/2723_B	well , now i have , uh , uh ,
sd/2723_B	i 'm getting close to retirement .
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	and , of course i 've been looking into it but , uh , since i 'm only a yellow badger ,
b/2723_A	uhhuh .
+/2723_B	i wo n't be getting a whole heck of a lot from t i ,
b/2723_A	right .
+/2723_B	as far as retirement is concerned .
qo/2723_A	what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a four o one account .
sd/2723_A	i , i 've been thinking about that for years , uh ,
sd/2723_B	i 've never heard of such a thing .
sd/2723_A	i know .
sd/2723_A	that 's what i 'm saying that , that pensions ,
sv/2723_A	you see , just like you were , you 're saying , you 've only got , uh , so many years ,
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
+/2723_A	and then just add the money together like you do with a four o one account , you know .
b/2723_B	uh , yeah .
sd/2723_A	uh , it 's your account , period .
sd/2723_A	it does n't matter where you go or anything .
sd/2723_A	that 's your account to roll over .
%/2723_B	i ,
sd/2723_B	that , that sounds like a hell of an idea .
sd/2723_B	i did n't know there was such a thing .
ar/2723_A	no ,
ar/2723_A	no
sd/2723_A	there is n't .
sd/2723_A	i , i 'm saying that 's the question .
^q/2723_A	what do you think could be better
sv/2723_A	and i 'm saying that pensions , say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away , which it probably will ,
sv/2723_A	i think they ought to have a pension at least that you 'd never lose .
sd/2723_A	so you work for a company seven years ,
b/2723_B	yes ,
ba/2723_B	by all means .
qw/2723_B	well , what would be the difference between that and social security ?
sv/2723_A	uh , well social security 's going to go to way , i think
sd/2723_A	and you can , or you can invest your own money .
sv/2723_A	you have no control over your social security .
sv/2723_A	and it 's not paid for by the current ,
%/2723_A	like when ,
sv/2723_A	say we retire after the year two thousand , social security 's paid for by the twentyfive year olds .
sv/2723_A	it 's there .
b/2723_B	yeah ,
b/2723_B	yeah .
sv/2723_A	you do n't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you , you know .
sd/2723_A	that 's just a thought .
%/2723_A	i mean , i ,
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
%/2723_A	if they say which ,
aa/2723_B	no ,
sd/2723_B	i , i like the idea .
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	course , that 's , that 's , some , something like an i r a
aa/2723_A	yeah ,
sv/2723_A	and instead of having a , a socialized pension , it just would be really money that you and your company ,
sv/2723_A	maybe you had to put some money in it , too ,
h/2723_A	i do n't really know .
sv/2723_A	but i ,
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
+/2723_A	i can see where they 'd need to do something on that because the statistics are ,
sv/2723_A	you do n't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own , you know .
sv/2723_A	you work for five , six , seven ,
%/2723_A	and y , y ,
sd/2723_A	a lot of people i know , guys ,
b/2723_B	yeah ,
sd/2723_B	that , that 's what i 've done .
sd/2723_B	i , i 've bounced around .
sd/2723_B	about every ten years ,
b/2723_A	yeah .
+/2723_B	i change .
sd/2723_A	i have , too ,
sd/2723_A	but not , not quite that often
%/2723_A	but , uh , yeah ,
sd/2723_A	i 've only got , uh , i 've got , i guess fourteen now here at t i ,
sd/2723_A	and i hope to make twentyfive which
sd/2723_A	say if something happened to me ,
sd/2723_A	i mean , you know , they lay me off ,
sd/2723_A	so , you have a pension
sd/2723_A	but then you 'd have to try to get a pension in another one .
sv/2723_A	it would be nice if they could get them together .
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
sd/2723_A	i do worry about medical , though .
sd/2723_A	again , knock wood that , uh , i have n't used it .
sv/2723_A	i guess you ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2723_A	i 'm sorry ,
sv/2723_A	you really do use it throughout the year , because you get your teeth fixed and all that ,
%/2723_A	i mean , i ,
%/2723_A	but i 'm not ,
sd/2723_A	i 'm talking about major items
sd/2723_A	i have n't used it for anything major .
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
sd/2723_A	i 'm glad it 's there , though .
sd/2723_B	well , knock wood ,
sd/2723_B	i have n't used mine for anything major . just doctor visits
sd/2723_B	and , well , i , i have the , uh , the h o m a .
sd/2723_B	i use h o m a .
b/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	and i like that , uh , a lot better than aetna
sd/2723_A	i have the regular .
%/2723_A	i , again , i just ,
%/2723_A	i have n't ,
sd/2723_A	i ca n't complain about it because i have n't used it
sd/2723_A	and every time i needed it , it , it , it 's , uh , you know ,
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
+/2723_A	fallen right in line for the , the , minor things
sd/2723_A	i guess i 'm the one just supporting most of the others .
qy/2723_B	well , does n't it work , you do n't see , uh , uh , anything until you spend the minimum ?
%/2723_A	uh ,
qy/2723_B	do n't you have to spend the minimum of two , three hundred ?
ny/2723_A	yeah ,
ny/2723_A	yeah ,
sd/2723_A	i think it 's two seventyfive for a family
sd/2723_A	but the dental is right away ,
b/2723_B	yeah .
+/2723_A	if you ,
%/2723_A	exams . uh ,

sd/2723_A	if you take an allergy medicine , so , anything you need a prescription for , for more than six months , you get it for , used to be six bucks ,
sd/2723_A	they just raised it to twelve .
sd/2723_B	oh , that one i have n't heard about .
b/2723_A	yeah ,
sd/2723_A	that 's a typical , that 's a typical one that 's in there .
sd/2723_A	the forms are right in personnel .
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
sd/2723_A	fact , you may be able to take care , take advantage of that .
sd/2723_A	it 's through baxter labs . uh ,
b/2723_B	yeah ,
sd/2723_B	i have high blood pressure problems myself .
sv/2723_A	maybe you still can do that .
qy/2723_A	do you , do you buy your pills one at a time ?

%/2723_A	you turn ,
sd/2723_A	you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription
sd/2723_A	and , uh , they 're twelve dollars ,
sd/2723_A	again , they just were six ,
sd/2723_A	they just raised them to twelve this year . twelve dollars for a three months supply .
%/2723_B	um .
+/2723_A	or whatever , whatever the , the amount is , uh .
sd/2723_A	i do n't want to say three months ,
sv/2723_A	but
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
+/2723_A	it 's a lot cheaper ,
sd/2723_A	allergy medicine 's really , uh , expensive
sd/2723_A	and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive .
sd/2723_A	i take two .
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
ad/2723_A	go right to personnel .
ad/2723_A	they got the forms in personnel

sd/2723_A	i do it ,
aa/2723_A	yeah ,
sv/2723_A	you know , it 's a very common thing .
ft/2723_B	well thanks ,
sd/2723_A	it 's through baxter labs ,

ft/2723_B	thanks for the tip , jim .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2723_A	yeah .
sd/2723_B	i shall look into it .
b/2723_A	yeah .
^h/2723_A	what else .
sv/2723_A	i 'm sure we 're getting close to our five minutes whatever , here .
aa/2723_B	yeah
^h/2723_B	. uh , let 's see ,
sd/2723_B	we discussed , uh , uh , medical and dental ,
qw/2723_A	what other benefits ,
sd/2723_B	uh , retirement .
aa/2723_A	yeah ,
sd/2723_A	salary continuation .
sv/2723_A	i think that 's a great one ,
sd/2723_A	but again a hope i never use that one .
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
sv/2723_A	that means you 're really sick if you have to use that one .
qo/2723_B	what about vacation ?
sd/2723_A	i 'm satisfied with the vacation .
sd/2723_A	i do n't know what else , you know ,
sd/2723_A	you say , say you get another week and ,
sd/2723_A	i 'm , well , i only got fourteen years
sd/2723_A	so i 'll get another week when i hit fifteen .
b/2723_B	uh , yeah ,
b/2723_B	that 's right .
sv/2723_A	so that 's , that 's fair ,
sv/2723_A	i mean , it 's reasonable .
sv/2723_A	four weeks is a lot , i think .
sd/2723_A	i know some people who have twentyfive years and thirty and they want more
%/2723_A	but , uh , you know ,
b/2723_B	uhhuh .
%/2723_A	uh .
sd/2723_B	well , i 'm , uh , i 'm here ,
sd/2723_B	i 've got just eleven years
sv/2723_B	and i do n't think i 'll ever see a , a silver badge .
b/2723_A	uhhuh .
sd/2723_B	i wo n't , i wo n't be around that long .
sd/2723_A	well , the way things go , i think i 'm going to have to work till i 'm seventyfive whether i quit and , uh , uh , or when i retire get a parttime job ,
sd/2854_A	well , we 're just starting a family through adoption
sd/2854_A	so i do n't really have a lot of , uh , concrete , uh , opinions .
sd/2854_A	just what i know out of my peer group , uh , has gone through .
sv/2854_A	and none of it has been good .
bh/2854_B	oh , really ?
ny/2854_A	yeah .
sd/2854_A	uh , the ones that can afford to have livein nannies ,
b/2854_B	huh .
+/2854_A	they seem to be having an okay time .
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
sv/2854_A	uh , but a lot of the other ones that have , are professional , uh ,
sv/2854_A	i 'd say fifty percent of , you know , my peers that i 'm , in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they 're , you know , going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade .
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
%/2854_A	uh , but i ,
sv/2854_A	there must be some good service out there if you
b/2854_B	right .
+/2854_A	really look and pay for it .
qw/2854_B	what , what age child are you thinking in terms of ?
qy^d/2854_A	in terms of what they 're talking about .
nn/2854_B	no .
sd/2854_B	for , for yourselves .
b/2854_A	oh .
sd/2854_A	infant . uh ...
bk/2854_B	oh , okay .
b/2854_A	infant .
sv/2854_B	so you 're starting from the b , from the baseline .
aa/2854_A	yeah .
sd/2854_A	after eleven years of marriage . yeah , we are .
sd/2854_A	we 're actually , it 's happening now .
sd/2854_A	so , we 're just going through the process .
b/2854_B	i see .
sd/2854_A	so an , and actually the question is , uh , very appropriate .
sd/2854_A	cause i 'm not sure whether , uh , how strong the maternal instinct is going to be .
sd/2854_A	they tell me it 's going to be strong .
qy/2854_A	do you
b/2854_B	right .
+/2854_A	have children ?
sd/2854_B	i have one son .
qy/2854_A	and did you put him in daycare
qrr/2854_A	or is he older now or younger
%/2854_A	or ?
sd/2854_B	well , he 's , he 's now eighteen . and in , in , you know , has completed a couple of years of university .
b/2854_A	sure .
sd/2854_A	so he 's out of daycare .
%/2854_B	i ,
b/2854_B	right .
%/2854_B	and , and so that ,
sd/2854_B	but i was working fulltime , uh
b/2854_A	you ,
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
+/2854_B	when he was born .
sd/2854_B	but i was very lucky because i was a , a college professor .
b/2854_A	oh .
sd/2854_B	and so i was able to , you know ,
sd/2854_B	and i , it was
%/2854_A	flex .
+/2854_B	walking distance from , from
b/2854_A	yeah .
+/2854_B	my apartment .
sd/2854_B	so i went up there
sd/2854_B	and i sort of left him with , with a neighbor .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
sd/2854_B	and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little .
sd/2854_B	and i said , you know , he does n't need anything except , you know , look at him if he cries .
sd/2854_B	but , you know , do n't pick him up and , and
b/2854_A	yeah .
+/2854_B	this sort of stuff .
sd/2854_B	because i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half .
ba/2854_A	oh , that 's wonderful .
sd/2854_B	and i was able to , you know , get , his schedule just , uh , cooperated .
b/2854_A	right .
%/2854_B	and ...
ba/2854_A	that 's wonderful .
b/2854_A	yeah .
b/2854_B	yeah .
sv/2854_A	and , and i guess , uh , th , because of your , um , your , uh , profession .
sd/2854_A	i mean , i , uh , i 'm in corporate communications .
sd/2854_A	but i 've done freelance writing in the past ,
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
sd/2854_A	so what we 're hoping is that , uh ,
sd/2854_A	i mean my husband thinks i can do it .
sd/2854_A	i 've just never worked out of a domestic base , you know .
sd/2854_A	i 've always
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
+/2854_A	been in a corporate , uh , environment .
sd/2854_A	uh , but i 'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or parttime
sd/2854_A	or if they do n't have that , uh ,
%/2854_A	my boss ,
sd/2854_A	i 'm very lucky though , again too , my boss is very akin to family building .
sv/2854_A	so , i think that 's som , th , something that couples need in going
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
+/2854_A	into this .
b/2854_B	right .
h/2854_A	uh , i do n't know .
sd/2854_A	i do think there 's good daycare out there .
qw/2854_A	what part of the country are you in ?
sd/2854_B	i 'm in maryland .
sd/2854_A	you 're in maryland .
sd/2854_B	but , but i was out of the country when , uh , my , my son was little .
sv/2854_B	but , but the thing is , if you have this flextime and that , you might be able to do something similar to what i did .
b/2854_A	right .
+/2854_B	which is
sd/2854_A	that 's what i 'm hoping .
+/2854_B	you know , be there short times
sd/2854_B	and then later on when he was , you know
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
%/2854_B	i mean this ,
sd/2854_B	we 're talking about , uh , i went back to work and , or taught some , some classes like a week after he was born .
ba/2854_A	oh , my goodness .
sv/2854_A	you were
%/2854_B	and so ...
+/2854_A	fortunate .
b/2854_A	yeah .
b/2854_B	yeah .
sd/2854_B	and so that 's when i was
b/2854_A	yeah .
+/2854_B	saying , you know , do n't , do n't pick him up and stuff .
sd/2854_B	but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
b/2854_A	sure .
sd/2854_B	and she , she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby 's laundry and this sort of stuff .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
sd/2854_B	and then , i also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
sd/2854_B	and , you know , in a sense she , she carried him around a lot , too much . uh , you know
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
+/2854_B	for , for my taste .
b/2854_A	right .
sv/2854_B	it was constantly , no , i do n't want him ,
x/2854_A	.
+/2854_B	to explore anything .
^q/2854_B	he might , uh , he might hurt himself .
qy/2854_A	so do you think that , i mean , do you think that that was in a way though , good ob , good objectivity that , that does n't really ,
sd/2854_A	that 's not a correct english
qy^d/2854_A	but , you know
x/2854_B	.
+/2854_A	in a sense , you see what i 'm saying though .
qy^d/2854_A	from a mother 's standpoint , i mean in a way , i , it was quote and unquote good ob , objectivity .
na/2854_B	i think it worked out very , very well .
sd/2854_B	because what he learned to do by the time he was
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
+/2854_B	two or so , he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers or
b/2854_A	see .
+/2854_B	writing lesson plans .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
sd/2854_B	and he had asked for a paper and , you know , sort of scribble
sd/2854_B	and then he realized that there
b/2854_A	yeah .
+/2854_B	were quiet times
sd/2854_B	and there were active times .
b/2854_A	right .
sd/2854_A	and then he learned he , he also learned that , uh , there were times that you had to be gone , so you probably minimized ,
sd/2854_A	well we 're actually , uh , we 're getting ready .
sd/2854_A	i mean , you 're far enough away now i can tell you since this is locally , i make sure , we 're going to romania in a few weeks .
b/2854_B	oh .
%/2854_A	and that 's , uh , just .
qy/2854_B	did you say romania
sd/2854_A	r ,
+/2854_B	or armenia ?
+/2854_A	romania .
bk/2854_B	oh , okay .
b/2854_B	yeah ,
b/2854_B	yeah .
sd/2854_A	as in , like , what twenty twenty and , uh , but we , we 're real excited because we 've just developed a contact .
ba/2854_B	oh , good .
+/2854_A	through professional people
sd/2854_A	and it 's private
sd/2854_A	and it 's hospital .
sd/2854_A	it 's , we 're just very excited .
^h/2854_A	uh ...
ba/2854_B	oh great .
+/2854_A	and w , i , i , what 's the word i 'm looking for .
sv/2854_A	when you deal with issues like that , uh , in terms of family building through adoption , uh , and then you have people responding to you , well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare .
bd/2854_B	oh that 's silly .
sd/2854_A	uh , issues are being raised prematurely in my mind .
sd/2854_A	but i guess they 're not because it 's something i 'll have to deal with sooner than later .
sd/2854_A	uh , and i , what i 've learned to do is just tune out everybody 's opinion .
sd/2854_A	i feel that if the child is healthy , uh , and as long as we make it feel secure , i 'd love to do something like with what you did .
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
sd/2854_A	uh , i do n't think i could be dumper where i could take it from , you know , eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there .
b/2854_B	right .
sd/2854_A	uh , maybe after two or three or , y , years old .
h/2854_A	i do n't know . um .
%/2854_B	oh , i , in my opinion , it 's even than .
sv/2854_B	i mean
b/2854_A	yeah .
+/2854_B	your kids need you .
sv/2854_A	well , they need a schedule i think .
sv/2854_A	i do n't think the united states ,
qw/2854_A	what country were you , uh , in europe when you were uh , uh ?
ar/2854_B	no ,
sd/2854_B	i was in the middle east .
%/2854_A	uh , that 's .
sv/2854_A	well , that 's the same thing .
h/2854_A	i mean i do n't know how they are there
sd/2854_A	but , uh , in eastern europe ,
sd/2854_A	my stepfather 's from england ,
sv/2854_A	it just seems the united states does not provide for either child care or geriat , or elder care , as i call it .
b/2854_B	right ,
b/2854_B	right .
sv/2854_A	uh , and we 're just not set up for that .
%/2854_A	uh , with the .
%/2854_B	i ,
b/2854_B	yeah .
ad/2854_A	go ahead .
ar/2854_B	no ,
sd/2854_B	i was just going to say , i guess , uh , my sensitivities are , are much more with the , you know , to be at home .
sd/2854_B	because actually , i had
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
+/2854_B	my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninetytwo until she died at ninetyseven .
ba/2854_A	see , i think that 's wonderful .
sd/2854_B	and , i mean , that was recently after my son , was going off .
%/2854_B	and i mean , yes ,
sd/2854_B	in a sense , i went to work
sd/2854_B	and she was at home alone some of the time .
sv/2854_B	but , but still , you know , it was much better than being shipped to
%/2854_A	to .
b/2854_A	right .
sv/2854_B	i think we 're t , we 're too , too much towards it 's somebody
^2/2854_A	we cast off .
+/2854_B	problem , you know .
b/2854_A	right ,
b/2854_A	right .
%/2854_A	th ,
sd/2854_A	i 'm that way .
%/2854_A	yeah .
^q/2854_B	i want to work .
^q/2854_B	shove them in , in some school for twelve hours a day .
b/2854_A	right .
sv/2854_A	it 's easier
sv/2854_A	and i agree with that .
%/2854_A	that 's why i
b/2854_B	yeah .
+/2854_A	y , you know ,
sv/2854_A	what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
sv/2854_A	but you can probably empathize with this .
sd/2854_A	it 's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts .
b/2854_B	right ,
b/2854_B	right .
sd/2854_A	in terms of what to do . uh ,
sv/2854_A	and i just do n't think there is a day , a good daycare system .
sd/2854_A	uh , my company , i 'm particularly fortunate that they have , they 're in tune with that .
sd/2854_A	but i 've been at companies where , uh , you know , the , deci , the , the trend is , or the definite mood is , well we made conscious decisions not to have children .
%/2854_A	you know .
%/2854_A	and in ,
sd/2854_A	and a couple like us building through adoption , there , it 's almost radical to some people .
sd/2854_A	and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
sd/2854_A	and , uh , i respect , there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they , you know , they may have the need for child care like that .
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
ba/2854_A	but i agree with you , that it 's just , i call it dumping .
b/2854_B	yeah .
%/2854_A	i , i ...
b/2854_B	no ,
sv/2854_B	i , i think that certainly there is a role , uh , for this type of help .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
sv/2854_B	and , and as long as one can , can supervise it and , and , you know , make it work in , into one 's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
+/2854_B	or , or , uh , giving it , you know , the whole job to somebody else to take care of .
^2/2854_A	then , yeah ,
sv/2854_A	it 's ar ,
+/2854_A	in tandem then .
b/2854_B	yeah ,
b/2854_B	yeah
x/2854_B	.
%/2854_A	i just , uh ,
sd/2854_A	and there are tradeoffs too i think .
sv/2854_A	one of the things that is a problem is that , uh , in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers .
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
sv/2854_A	uh , it 's just , you know , it 's so low
sd/2854_A	but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis , it 's prohibitive .
sd/2854_A	and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year
b/2854_B	yeah .
+/2854_A	uh ...
sd/2854_B	actually , there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood .
%/2854_B	is
b/2854_A	really .
sv/2854_B	there seem , there are several , u , u , m , mothers who stay home .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
%/2854_B	and they take , you know ,
sv/2854_B	it 's probably not completely legal .
%/2854_B	uh , i ,
sv/2854_B	maybe it 's legal up to one or two additional kids .
b/2854_A	sure .
sd/2854_B	but , and they , they take care of another child
sd/2854_B	and i , i can actually n , could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
%/2854_A	and they ,
b/2854_A	yeah .
sv/2854_B	and i mean that 's another possibility
sv/2854_B	and , you know , you might want to stay home one year
sv/2854_B	and some other lady might want to stay home for a , a few years
%/2854_B	and ...
sd/2854_A	i have n't thought about that .
b/2854_A	yeah .
sd/2854_A	and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
sd/2854_A	and she 's at home parttime paralegal .
%/2854_A	so i 'm thinking , um
x/2854_A	.
b/2854_B	yeah ,
b/2854_B	yeah .
sd/2854_A	and we get along fantastically
%/2854_A	so i 'm thinking , you know .
sv/2854_A	and that 's the way you have to , uh ,
%/2854_A	how wa ,
sd/2854_A	i 'm just real curious .
qo/2854_A	how was the middle east in terms of that with children ?
qy/2854_A	is that , is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them ?
nn/2854_B	no .
sd/2854_B	well , actually there was a daycare center , uh , where my son did go for a year .
sd/2854_B	i think from when he was two to three .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
sd/2854_B	but then he actually started kindergarten at age three .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
sd/2854_B	and so , and i , you know , it was n't like prekindergarten ,
sd/2854_B	it was real kindergarten .
b/2854_A	oh , really .
sv/2854_A	he must be smart .
b/2854_A	yeah .
aa/2854_B	yeah .
sd/2854_B	so he , he was ready to , to go to school at that point .
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
ny/2854_B	but , yeah ,
sd/2854_B	they 're , they do have such facilities .
sv/2854_B	but for the most part , uh , th , with the extended family , you know , you can usually find somebody . which is much like our neighbor
b/2854_A	uhhuh .
+/2854_B	you know , to , sharing responsibility .
sd/2854_B	and i 'm , and also there are n't that many women who , who d , who work .
sd/2854_A	the professional .
b/2854_A	yeah ,
sd/2854_A	i was wondering about that .
b/2854_B	yeah .
%/2854_A	uh , there ,
sd/2854_A	i 'm in dallas
sd/2854_A	and there was just a very big , uh , series about moslem women
sd/2854_A	and
b/2854_B	uhhuh .
+/2854_A	there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts .
sd/2854_A	i 'm digressing here
qy^d/2854_A	but , uh , i was just real curious when you said middle east , if you
b/2854_B	yeah .
+/2854_A	did n't mind me asking .
nn/2854_B	no ,
nn/2854_B	no .
sd/2854_B	and i did n't mean israel .
qy^d/2854_B	so you , you assumed right .
nn/2854_A	oh , no
bd/2854_A	that 's okay .
sd/2854_A	well , even if you did , that 's okay actually .
%/2854_A	i think ...
arp_nd/2854_B	well , no
sd/2854_B	because at first thought , when i s , you know , i said that not many people work , i 'm , i 'm thinking oh , well she 's going to , you know , because certainly in israel the women do work .
b/2854_A	right .
b/2854_A	right .
sd/2854_A	they fight ,
sd/2854_A	they work .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/3051_B	there you go .
sd/3051_B	first question ,
qy/3051_B	do you own your house ?
na/3051_A	uh , right ,
sd/3051_A	well , we try .
sd/3051_A	i mean it 's a big mortgage in the sky
sd/3051_A	and someday , maybe , we might even own it ,
sd/3051_A	but , um , for all practical purposes , i guess we hold the mortgage .
sd/3051_B	our name is on the till ,
b/3051_A	yeah ,
b/3051_A	right .
sd/3051_B	so that implies ownership .
sd/3051_A	no one else has offered to pay for it .
aa/3051_B	that 's right .
sd/3051_B	i would not object if anybody did .
b/3051_A	yeah ,
sd/3051_A	really they could move right into the spare room .
b/3051_B	yeah .
sd/3051_B	well , we have , we have had this one for five years now .
sd/3051_B	before that we lived in garland , uh , probably about , you know , four blocks away .
b/3051_A	uhhuh .
sd/3051_B	liked the area , chose to stay inside of spring park .
%/3051_B	it 's a , uh ,
qy^d/3051_B	i do n't know if you have been up here ,
sd/3051_B	but it is a residential homeowners ,
b/3051_A	right ,
b/3051_A	yeah ,
+/3051_B	association .
sd/3051_B	so , there 's a lot of , you know , activities , a lot of pluses and common land .
sd/3051_B	but , uh , we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market , you know ,
sd/3051_B	it could not possibly have gone any lower
sd/3051_B	and so we were wrong .
bf/3051_A	oh , five years ago .
aa/3051_B	yeah .
b/3051_A	yeah ,
%/3051_B	i think ,
%/3051_B	what ,
sd/3051_B	it bottom out about a ye , year later .
b/3051_A	yeah ,
%/3051_A	it , well ,
sv/3051_A	i mean just recently , i would say , i would give it two years back , when it was , i think , bottomed out .
aa/3051_B	oddly enough , two years , you know ,
%/3051_B	i , uh , i think that ,
sv/3051_A	but , maybe not in your area ,
sd/3051_A	see , it was just different areas ,
sd/3051_B	not in , in , uh , this area .
%/3051_B	cause this is about like the ,
sv/3051_A	that 's a really nice area .
b/3051_B	yeah .
qy/3051_A	besides , it 's , you know , it 's not , it 's not richardson . is it ?
qy^d/3051_A	it 's still considered garland .
nn/3051_B	no ,
sd/3051_B	it 's , it 's richardson .
bk/3051_A	oh , ok ,
b/3051_A	yeah .
sd/3051_B	it 's , richardson
ad/3051_B	and , hold on a second .
t3/3051_B	paul , i can hear you perfectly , perfectly well ,
t3/3051_B	i do n't want to hear you .
t3/3051_B	you are being rude .
t3/3051_B	whatever you ask or scream when i 'm on the phone , the answer is no .
t3/3051_B	do you understand ?
qw/3051_B	how does that sound ?
ba/3051_A	there you go .
ad/3051_A	write that one down .
b/3051_B	yeah ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/3051_B	there i go .
sd/3051_A	it sounded good to me .
b/3051_B	yeah ,
sd/3051_B	well , i hate to say how long that will last too .
^h/3051_B	no ,
sd/3051_B	this area up here is , uh , all custom homes ,
%/3051_B	and ,
b/3051_A	right .
+/3051_B	it 's ,
sd/3051_B	i do n't think that many by the builder that built this house .
sd/3051_B	and , we were not the first people , the first owners ,
sd/3051_B	i think we are the third owners .
b/3051_A	uh , okay .
sd/3051_B	it was built by the architect for himself , who never moved into it . who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep .
ba/3051_A	oh , no .
ba/3051_B	oh , yeah ,
sd/3051_B	caulking windows was a great mystery to them .
ba/3051_A	oh , gee .
sd/3051_B	so , they just watched the water pour in on the carpet .
sd/3051_B	but , it 's a sharif myneer homes , if that means anything ,
sd/3051_B	it did not really mean anything to me except ,
sd/3051_A	i , i ,
+/3051_B	i liked it .
+/3051_A	kept thinking of omar sharif every time i saw that name somewhere ,
%/3051_A	so ,
sd/3051_B	he builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now .
sd/3051_B	i think he got out of the lower end market .
b/3051_A	uh .
+/3051_B	and decided ,
sd/3051_B	but , the houses here in , in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred .
ba/3051_A	oh , wow .
b/3051_B	yeah ,
sd/3051_B	well but , still i know that this one was built for two ninety nine , which is nowhere near what we paid for it .
b/3051_A	right .
sd/3051_B	and i think somebody told me it 's also on a creek side lot , heavily wooded off the golf course .
ba/3051_A	oh , great .
b/3051_B	yeah ,
sd/3051_B	and the guy around the corner is being transferred
sd/3051_B	so he said , uh , well , he did comparables that it 's about eighty dollars ,
^h/3051_B	let 's see what ,
sd/3051_B	i do n't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot ,
b/3051_A	well
+/3051_B	off the creek and eighty on the creek ,
+/3051_A	yeah .
+/3051_B	or , if it was eighty and a hundred .
sv/3051_A	probably eighty .
ar/3051_B	i think it was sixty , eighty .
b^m/3051_A	sixty , eighty .
h/3051_B	i think .
sd/3051_A	well because , i know our , our little house over here stuck in the middle of , you know , the subdivision is , i think fifty five ,
sv/3051_A	so , i think the high end is definitely , you know somewhere there .
ad/3051_B	well , try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot .
ar/3051_B	no ,
sv/3051_B	it could not be ,
sd/3051_B	because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet ,
sv/3051_B	and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars .
b/3051_A	yeah .
sv/3051_B	just never .
%/3051_A	well .
sv/3051_B	now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for , uh , brand new ,
sv/3051_B	or that 's pretty much what it was built for .
sd/3051_B	it 's got an awful lot of nice things in it
sv/3051_B	but , you know , i do n't think , i think it 's going to be a long time , if ever , when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really , uh , desirable .
sv/3051_B	it 's seems like people go for square footage only now
b/3051_A	yeah .
qy/3051_B	and , uh , cause . have you been back to the perry homes , back here ?
br/3051_A	um , the ones that look like brick houses ?
sd/3051_B	the one that looks like monopoly apartments .
b/3051_A	right .
ny/3051_A	yeah ,
sv/3051_A	i think those are awful .
fa/3051_A	i 'm sorry ,
sd/3051_A	i just do n't see the designer 's ,
sd/3051_A	i just see him as trying to squish as much space , you know , as much house into the space as possible .
sd/3051_B	they are huge when you are inside them .
b/3051_A	yeah .
sd/3051_B	they are very spacious .
%/3051_B	they are , you know ,
sd/3051_B	i was , i was in one today .
sd/3051_B	it was forty two hundred square feet .
b/3051_A	uh .
b/3051_B	yeah .
b/3051_B	uhhuh .
%/3051_A	well see that 's ,
sd/3051_A	the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i ,
sd/3051_A	because there 's just the two of us
sd/3051_A	and the two cats , um , can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard .
sd/3051_A	and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know .
sv/3051_B	see , when you have kids , you like to be able to ,
aa/3051_A	yeah ,
aa/3051_A	that 's true .
+/3051_B	send them some place where they can yell and you wo n't hear them .
sd/3051_B	but , i have been watching these houses go up
%/3051_B	and i , i do n't , well ,
sd/3051_B	somebody was telling me ,
sd/3051_B	i know somebody who lives back there ,
sd/3051_B	i have always questioned the quality of construction
sv/3051_B	and i , i do n't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house .
b/3051_A	oh .
sv/3051_B	when you watch them go up , you are just amazed that they do not fall over .
b/3051_A	yeah .
sd/3051_B	and it takes them something like , thirty days to complete a house .
ba/3051_A	oh , that 's amazing .
sd/3051_A	right now , in fact , even as we speak , we are having a deck put on in back ,
sd/3051_A	and these guys are phenomenal .
sd/3051_A	they just , they , they are doing such a terrific job back there ,
sd/3051_A	i mean , you know , you pay for it too ,
sd/3051_A	but it 's , it 's like , really worth it .
sd/3051_A	they are putting in a deck ,
b/3051_B	uhhuh .
+/3051_A	a redwood deck ,
sd/3051_A	and it 's just , they are doing such a fine , fine job .
sd/3051_B	we have got
sd/3051_A	i 'm really excited about it ,
+/3051_B	three different levels of decking , because ,
b/3051_A	uhhuh .
+/3051_B	this lot slopes way back down
sd/3051_B	and , uh , the house is built around the trees .
ba/3051_A	great .
sd/3051_B	and with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up
sd/3051_B	so , it 's real , real shady .
sd/3051_B	but , that 's one of the few things that really , uh , immediately pays back on return .
sd/3051_B	but , what i was going to tell you , these perry homes back there ,
b/3051_A	yeah .
sd/3051_B	when the people from m c i come down
sd/3051_B	and they are , you know , they are used to the virginia area , metropolitan d c .
b/3051_A	uh .
sd/3051_B	my god , they come down here and those houses , that , that look the colonial look what the ,
bf/3051_A	looks like the george town brownstone .
aa/3051_B	right ,
b/3051_A	yeah .
sv/3051_B	and , uh , the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it , for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars ,
^2/3051_A	must be a dream .
+/3051_B	which is probably about what their equity is , that they got out of selling their house .
b/3051_A	yeah .
sd/3051_B	because those things are selling like hot cakes .
sd/3051_B	but , one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill , per month , last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars
b/3051_A	oh .
+/3051_B	a month .
%/3051_B	and i thought ,
ba/3051_A	i ca n't ,
sd/3051_B	and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here .
sd/3051_B	and i was thinking , well , you know , i know why your god damn bill is so high ,
sv/3051_A	he has no insulation , probably .
sd/3051_B	it 's because there 's not a there 's no insulation , insulation in those things .
ba/3051_A	oh , my .
b/3051_B	yeah .
ba/3051_A	gosh .
bh/3051_A	what a trap . huh .
%/3051_B	any yet , you know ,
sd/3051_B	they , they show very well un , they show very well unless you have , you know , lived in a lot of houses around the area ,
sd/3051_A	and you ask the right questions and can research ,
b/3051_A	yeah .
+/3051_B	or looked at a lot of houses around here .
b/3051_A	yeah .
sv/3051_B	and i think that makes a big difference .
sd/3051_B	but , i like , i like this area
sd/3051_B	and everything that i have been saying ,
sd/3051_A	oh , i do too .
+/3051_B	says that it 's ,
sv/3051_B	i think if we had to sell now , we could come close to breaking even .
sv/3051_A	but , still , um , it 's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that .
%/3051_B	you 're in , you 're in the ,
qo/4114_A	so , how you like new jersey ?
sv/4114_B	uh , it 's pretty good , you know .
sd/4114_B	you get , uh , closer to the , uh , coast here ,
sd/4114_B	and you do get a good bit of , uh , smog and stuff , especially from all the , uh , fuel cracking towers and chemical plants .
b/4114_A	right ,
qy/4114_A	i guess , uh , i do n't know what part of new jersey you 're in , but i guess it 's , uh , fairly industrial ?
ny/4114_B	yeah ,
%/4114_B	it 's ,
sd/4114_B	when you get further east towards new york city it gets very industrial
b/4114_A	right , uhhuh .
sd/4114_B	but i 'm , i 'm about , uh , thirty miles west of there
sd/4114_B	so you have , uh , actually green trees and such that you
b/4114_A	yeah .
+/4114_B	do n't notice that , that other part of
b/4114_A	yeah .
+/4114_B	new jersey exists .
b/4114_A	right .
%/4114_B	actually very ,
x/4114_A	.
sd/4114_B	y , you know , you go even a few wi , miles out and you got , uh , farms and everything
sd/4114_B	so you , relatively clear air .
b/4114_A	right .
%/4114_B	but , uh ,
h/4114_A	well , i do n't know about you ,
sv/4114_A	but i 've always considered automobiles to be , probably the , the prime contributor .
sv/4114_A	i mean there 's a lot of contributors ,
sv/4114_A	but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that .
aa/4114_B	oh , d , definitely .
%/4114_B	it 's
b/4114_A	yeah .
sd/4114_B	uh , you know , there are a large number of them on the road .
sd/4114_B	they 're all , you know , going ,
sv/4114_B	and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair .
sv/4114_A	that 's , yeah , that 's , that 's a big issue is , you know ,
sd/4114_A	a lot of states do n't have a , uh , inspection law
sv/4114_A	so you get , you get a lot of people out there without e t r , emission control systems on their cars and things like that .
sv/4114_B	oh , e , even where you do have the inspections , you know , the inspection is once a year .
b/4114_A	yeah ,
%/4114_A	and it 's like ,
sv/4114_B	you get the car that 's in the accident
sv/4114_B	and muffler falls off or something
b/4114_A	sure .
sv/4114_B	and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that .
b/4114_A	right .
sd/4114_A	i guess , from what i hear , though , uh , next year ford is coming out with their electric cars .
sd/4114_A	they 're actually coming out with the first prototypes in california .
b/4114_B	yeah ,
%/4114_B	that ,
sd/4114_B	and i think also some of the , uh , car companies are coming out with , uh , gas powered fleets
b/4114_A	yeah .
+/4114_B	so you ,
sd/4114_B	natural gas powered rather than , uh , gasoline .
b/4114_A	right .
sd/4114_A	i hope , i , i 'm hoping that comes along quick .
sd/4114_A	uh , i was reading a , an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that 's going
sv/4114_A	and i guess it 's , it 's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize
sv/4114_A	and i know that 's not due to , uh , it 's not due to , to gasoline or to , you know , carbon monoxide so much as the c f c s
%/4114_A	but ,
sd/4114_B	it , it is coming from cars , though .
aa/4114_A	uh , yeah ,
sv/4114_A	i think that 's a , that 's a contributor definitely .
sd/4114_B	i mean , the , uh , car air conditioners is
b/4114_A	right .
+/4114_B	one of the major leaking sources of , uh , the , uh , freon .
b/4114_A	right .
+/4114_B	which is one of the major flor , chlorofar , fluorocarbons .
b/4114_A	yeah ,
sv/4114_A	i guess right now what they 're , what they 're primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess united states and , and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production ,
%/4114_A	but
%/4114_B	well , it , it ,
+/4114_A	it ,
ad/4114_A	go ahead .
ar/4114_B	no ,
sv/4114_B	it 's , it 's the type of thing there that , uh , you know ,
sd/4114_B	the third world countries are less industrial
sd/4114_B	and they want to become industrial
b/4114_A	uhhuh .
sd/4114_B	so they 're on the different part of the cycle of the u s .
sd/4114_B	the u s used , you know , all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today .
b/4114_A	right .
sd/4114_A	and that 's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is , that basically they do n't want to have to pay for our mistakes if , if that makes any sense .
%/4114_A	uh , in terms of ,
sd/4114_B	or , or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way , where we
aa/4114_A	exactly .
+/4114_B	got to .
aa/4114_A	exactly .
sv/4114_A	uh , those of kind of , yeah , those are joining arguments ,
h/4114_A	but , uh , i do n't know ,
sv/4114_A	that 's , that 's kind of an interesting situation there .
sv/4114_A	uh , what they do n't realize , those third world countries , what they do n't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting .
sd/4114_A	i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles
sd/4114_A	and it 's , it 's increasing even as far near the equator as like florida and cuba and those places .
b/4114_B	yeah .
sv/4114_A	so it 's kind of an interesting situation .
sv/4114_A	it 's not , not a real good one actually .
aa/4114_B	no .
%/4114_A	but ,
sv/4114_B	well , you also have the very close related thing of the , uh , rain forest destruction
b/4114_A	yeah .
+/4114_B	which is the main source of what 's clearing out the atmosphere and
b/4114_A	uhhuh ,
aa/4114_A	yeah .
+/4114_B	replacing some of the pollutants .
b/4114_A	yeah ,
sv/4114_A	you do n't get that , that source of cleansing anymore .
qy/4114_A	are , have you been in big cities a long time ?
na/4114_B	mostly , i 've mostly been in the east coast ,
sd/4114_B	so that 's going between atlanta , washing , d c area ,
bk/4114_A	okay ,
%/4114_A	so you 've got ,
%/4114_B	a ,
b/4114_A	yeah ,
sv/4114_A	those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard , i would think .
sd/4114_B	well , not , not as hard as some places out west because you do n't get the , uh , major pollution sources as you do out in denver with the
aa/4114_A	yeah ,
sd/4114_A	denver 's definitely
+/4114_B	inversion
aa/4114_A	yeah ,
sv/4114_A	that 's one of the worst .
+/4114_B	and los angeles and a , rest of california which is just terrible it sounds .
aa/4114_A	sure .
aa/4114_A	yeah ,
sd/4114_A	denver 's that , that real good e , that real good , uh , example of sitting in a valley , kind of like mexico city does , i guess .
b/4114_B	uhhuh .
sd/4114_A	mexico city is historically been one of the worst
b/4114_B	yeah .
+/4114_A	in the , in the world for that .
sv/4114_A	but i 've been pretty lucky ,
sd/4114_A	i 've lived in cities that really have n't had that much of a problem , although , uh , i 'm really kind of based in orlando , florida
sv/4114_A	and there , you can tell that it 's getting worse .
sd/4114_A	i mean , it , it definitely it 's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver
%/4114_A	but you can ,
b/4114_B	yeah ,
sv/4114_B	there , it 's almost all automobiles because there 's not that much in the way of
aa/4114_A	exactly .
+/4114_B	heavy industry , you know , that would be causing it .
aa/4114_A	yeah .
sd/4114_A	and there 's not that much in terms of , of public transportation down there .
b/4114_B	uhhuh .
%/4114_A	there is ,
%/4114_A	but it 's kind of it 's ,
qo/2840_A	do you have any particular thoughts about the school system ?
%/2840_B	well , um , i , i think that in , in , uh ,
%/2840_B	recently with the ,
sv/2840_B	i 'm not sure if it 's more a problem with american families or a problem with the school system .
sv/2840_B	they seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems , any problems that a child might have , whether it 's actually a school related thing or not
%/2840_B	and ,
x/2840_A	.
+/2840_B	i .
aa/2840_A	i say agree with you a hundred percent there .
b/2840_B	yeah ,
sv/2840_B	and , and , well , it 's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything .
b/2840_A	yeah .
sv/2840_B	if , uh , you 've some kid who does n't have , uh , who 's from a broken family , the schools are supposed to fill that void .
x/2840_A	.
+/2840_B	uh , you know , teaching classes
b/2840_A	yeah .
+/2840_B	and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like , oh , were kind of traditionally the school 's roles .
b/2840_A	yeah ,
sv/2840_A	it 's interesting
sd/2840_A	because , uh , we 're just having conversation on this , uh , with a couple of people yesterday .
sd/2840_A	and i was expressing my frustrations that , uh , some of the , so many problems , i work in a high school , are that kids do n't have a , a degree of selfdiscipline which may be reflected in society at large .
sv/2840_A	uh , and you ca n't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract , uh , sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home .
b/2840_B	right .
sv/2840_A	um , and , it 's seen more so because when you call parents up , many parents wo n't even recognize that there is a problem
sv/2840_A	and i 'll say , they 'll say , oh , well , our kids , my kid ,
^q/2840_A	i 've never heard anything about this before .
^q/2840_A	this is the first time there have been problems .
sv/2840_A	and , and , you wonder , do n't these parents know that teachers talk ,
sd/2840_A	and , you know , we do check with other teachers ,
sd/2840_A	and other teachers find the same things in
b/2840_B	right .
+/2840_A	this child .
sd/2840_A	and , you know , how do you tell your parent 's , the parent , hey , wake up , and smell the coffee .
b/2840_B	right .
sv/2840_A	but , um , it , it is a problem ,
sv/2840_A	and i 'm not sure just , uh , how , how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it .
b/2840_B	yeah .
sv/2840_A	whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a , uh , and the parents being informed better , that in fact that the problems that are nationwide
b/2840_B	yeah .
+/2840_A	are problems , um , of society , and that , that the school can only do so much on it .
sv/2840_B	well , then , then again when you have , uh , a society where a certain percentage of the parents are , uh , doing drugs in the home
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
+/2840_B	uh , either unemployed and do n't care about a , uh , just a have their own problems
b/2840_A	yeah ,
b/2840_A	yeah .
+/2840_B	how , how do you expect the school to , um , or how do you expect the ,
sv/2840_B	you ca n't really expect that parent who 's , quite frankly
aa/2840_A	that 's right .
+/2840_B	a loser in life , as it is
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
+/2840_B	to , to care about the , the situation with their child ,
%/2840_B	and ,
sv/2840_A	you know what scares me too , is that we have yet to see other , the biggest effect of the crack children
b/2840_B	right .
+/2840_A	uh , in the school system .
sv/2840_A	these are children that are born with low deficit , attention deficit
b/2840_B	right .
qh/2840_A	and , gosh , what 's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system .
sv/2840_A	that 's really scary .
b/2840_B	yeah .
sv/2840_A	but there are , i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve ,
sd/2840_A	and this is something that i see .
sv/2840_A	too many times students get diagnosed as mo , slow learners ,
sv/2840_A	and in fact they 're not .
sv/2840_A	they 're behavior problems .
b/2840_B	right .
sv/2840_A	and so , they get put in , in , in our school system , in a class that 's limited for skills children
b/2840_B	uhhuh .
+/2840_A	that have , really have to master skills .
sv/2840_A	and that 's not their problem .
sv/2840_A	um , at the same time , i 've seen , we , we have a , an international population .
sv/2840_A	there 's no bridge area for students coming out of the e s o l , which is english for speakers of other languages
b/2840_B	uhhuh .
+/2840_A	program .
%/2840_A	the ,
sv/2840_A	once they 're past e s o l , they get out ,
sv/2840_A	they got thrown right into the total mainstream
b/2840_B	right .
sv/2840_A	and , uh , there really needs to be a bridge , some sort of transition
b/2840_B	right .
+/2840_A	for that .
sv/2840_A	so the school systems can improve , both in standing up for splitting classes , you know , having learning dis , learning , slow , slow children in slow classes , but not mixing them with behavior problems .
b/2840_B	right .
sv/2840_A	and then , you know , the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes ,
sv/2840_A	you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated .
b/2840_B	right .
sv/2840_A	and then you throw in kids that are not motivated , maybe bright , but they 're discipline problems .
%/2840_A	and you sometimes
sv/2840_A	the average classes really are problems
b/2840_B	uhhuh .
+/2840_A	because you 've got such a mixed bag there .
b/2840_B	right .
sd/2840_A	you know , the gifted and talented are fast classes .
%/2840_A	there 's really not that much of a problem with .
%/2840_A	but it 's ,
sd/2840_B	well , i , i 've seen more , uh , incredibly intelligent underachievers than ,
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
+/2840_B	than , uh ,
sd/2840_B	i personally i will , i would take a person who 's motivated and a little , uh , less intelligent
%/2840_A	that 's ,
b/2840_A	yeah .
+/2840_B	than the person who , uh , is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of , is n't motivated to do anything .
sd/2840_A	i remember i had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration , and ninetynine percent perspiration .
b/2840_B	yeah .
sd/2840_B	well , i , not to toot my own horn here or anything , but i , i was graduated from my high school ,
sd/2840_B	i was the valedictorian ,
sd/2840_B	and i know
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
+/2840_B	that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me ,
sd/2840_B	and they proved out late when it came time to take the s a t s .
sd/2840_B	mine were
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
+/2840_B	good ,
sd/2840_B	but they were n't great .
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
sd/2840_B	and , uh , when i got into college i struggled , i struggled just to , uh , get my degree in the , in the field that i was in .
b/2840_A	yeah .
sd/2840_B	whereas i knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all ,
sd/2840_B	but they got motivated in college
sd/2840_B	and they did a lot better than i did .
%/2840_B	and when it ,
b/2840_A	yeah .
sv/2840_A	i guess kids do mature at different ages
b/2840_B	right .
+/2840_A	too .
%/2840_A	that 's ,
sd/2840_A	and , you know , as a teacher you , you try to make , be understanding that , you know , there are different ages ,
%/2840_A	kids are ,
%/2840_A	is this a ,
sd/2840_A	got a kid that just a question of maturity ,
sd/2840_A	or is he a
b/2840_B	uhhuh .
+/2840_A	problem child .
sv/2840_A	but teachers are asked to diagnose so much .
%/2840_A	um , there , i mean , i mean we 're , have to be ,
%/2840_A	we 're alerted
b/2840_B	right .
sd/2840_A	there 's all sorts of systems where suicide , uh , predisposition .
sd/2840_A	i mean , we 're alerted to what the moment we see something .
sd/2840_A	if we see a child that we have any reason , that 's on drugs , such as if he 's got a beeper or if they 're , if they 're flashing lots of money around . we 've , there are certain things to do .
sd/2840_A	i mean , so tea , the school system 's asked to do so much ,
sv/2840_A	but you ca n't operate in a vacuum .
qy/2840_B	you actually have students with , with beepers ?
no/2840_A	this is a , we 're in a rather wealthy suburb of washington .
b/2840_B	uhhuh .
sd/2840_A	and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the , uh , principal .
%/2840_B	i mean , where ,
%/2840_B	what are the ,
qo/2840_B	what could they possibly be thinking .
%/2840_B	i mean how .
sd/2840_A	it 's for drug use .
sd/2840_A	they ca n't imagine for anything else .
b/2840_B	yeah
x/2840_B	.
b/2840_A	yeah .
sv/2840_A	you know , it 's , it 's amazing ,
sv/2840_A	but uh , you get all sorts , you get all , all sorts of things , uh , in the schools , uh , uh ,
%/2840_A	and it 's ,
sd/2840_A	and you know , as a teacher you 're alert , you 're alert for the kid who 's very drowsy .
sd/2840_A	you 're alert to the kid who suddenly has a , um , behavioral change ,
sd/2840_A	and you refer them to the nurse .
b/2840_B	right .
sd/2840_A	and , so , i mean , you have to find out whether there 's a legitimate reason , or whether this is a warning signal .
b/2840_B	yeah ,
qh/2840_B	can you , how can you , how can you expect to ,
b/2840_B	oh yeah ,
sd/2840_B	i , i , i was , uh , sitting in the barber shop .
sd/2840_B	i 'm an officer in the air force ,
sd/2840_B	and i was having my hair cut
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
sd/2840_B	and the barber got a call while i was there , uh , from his son 's school .
sd/2840_B	his son 's in high school .
sd/2840_B	and his son was failing gym and , uh , and having trouble ,
x/2840_A	.
+/2840_B	with a few other things .
sd/2840_B	but , you know , it 's like , uh , this guy was like , why now , there 's no problem with my kid .
sd/2840_B	my kid 's a great kid and all this .
sd/2840_B	the kid had missed all these classes ,
sd/2840_B	and basically
b/2840_A	uhhuh .
+/2840_B	he , his answer was , oh , i gave him permission to , to miss .
b/2840_A	yeah ,
sv/2840_A	the denial mechanism is really strong
sv/2840_A	and so many parents are facilitators .
b/2840_B	yeah .
sv/2840_A	i mean , they 're manipulated by their children .
b/2840_B	right .
sd/2840_A	i 've been fortunate .
sd/2840_A	i have , uh , a son who 's a sophomore in college up in massachusetts
b/2840_B	uhhuh .
+/2840_A	at , uh , amherst ,
sd/2840_A	and my other son is a senior in high school ,
sd/2840_A	and he 's going on to williams .
sd/2840_A	and i mean , they 're really super .
sd/2840_A	they 're both national level
ba/2840_B	sure .
+/2840_A	swimmers ,
sd/2840_A	and where we 've been very fortunate ,
sd/2840_A	but , you know , they had to be held accountable
b/2840_B	right .
+/2840_A	too .
sv/2840_A	i mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , but in , in some ways ,
sv/2840_A	but , but you have to say at what point is n't the help becoming negative .
ba/2840_B	sure .
sv/2840_A	and i think this is where the school system at , is suffering , and not through any fault of the effort
b/2840_B	right .
+/2840_A	of the school system .
fc/2840_A	but gee it was good talking with you .
fc/2840_B	it was good talking to you too .
fc/2840_A	yeah ,
fc/2840_A	so there are people throughout the country that feel
fc/2840_B	yeah .
+/2840_A	the same ways that you do , and , and are connected with the schools .
fc/2840_B	yeah ,
fc/2840_B	i 've had interesting conversations on several subjects not , uh , not just this but different , the different
fc/2840_A	uhhuh .
+/2840_B	things .
fc/2840_B	it 's amazing how the , you know , people you talk to have some interesting conversations
fc/2840_B	and , uh , it 's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base , and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all .
fc/2840_A	well , we are , though .
fc/2840_B	yeah ,
fc/2840_B	that 's true .
fc/2840_A	listen ,
fc/2840_A	good luck .

ny/2528_B	yes .
qw/2528_A	when was that on ?
sd/2528_B	it was usually on , um , thursday nights .
qy/2528_A	on a b c ?
h/2528_B	i do n't know .
b/2528_A	oh , oh , yeah ,
sv/2528_A	well , um , um , it may be that , um , it was recently replaced , by actually by , um , by what may be my favorite t v show of , because sort of , uh , um , twin peaks .
sd/2528_B	it was same time period ,
aa/2528_B	yes .
b/2528_A	yeah ,
sd/2528_A	so , twin peaks , um , what happened was , i think , twin peaks , um , went , went off , they moved to a saturday night for a while . and then put , and then put something , i guess , gabriel 's fire on it , and at thursday nights ,
sd/2528_A	and then they moved , um ,
t1/2528_A	no ,
sv/2528_A	gabriel 's fire was on c b s , i think ,
sd/2528_A	i , i take that back .
h/2528_A	i 'm not sure ,
sd/2528_A	but anyway they moved it back and forth
sd/2528_A	and that 's when peaks was back in that time slot as well .
h/2528_A	so , i do n't know .
qy/2528_B	you do n't know what happened to gabriel 's fire then ?
nn/2528_A	no ,
sd/2528_A	i have no idea .
sd/2528_A	i do n't think , i do n't think that was on a b c , anyway i do n't know what happened to it though .
sd/2528_B	i do n't remember one , from one station to another .
sd/2528_B	i keep forgetting one station .
x/2528_A	.
qw/2528_B	what 's your second favorite ?
^h/2528_A	um , it 's hard to say
sd/2528_A	i 'm sort of a very big twin peaks fan ,
sd/2528_A	and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on .
sd/2528_A	i 'm , i 'm , half the time i 'm a t v addict
sd/2528_A	and the other half the time i just ignore it
sd/2528_A	it 's really bad .
%/2528_A	yeah ,
sd/2528_A	there 's some new shows that i sort of like , um ,
qy^d/2528_A	have you seen this shannon field show
sd/2528_A	or , uh , it 's about a lawyer , it 's one of these lawyer shows , you know ,
sv/2528_A	they seem to be popular these days .
sv/2528_A	and there 's a lot of those blair shows floating around .
qy/2528_B	oh , is he the reformed , um , gambler ?
ny/2528_A	yeah .
aa/2528_B	yes ,
aa/2528_B	yes ,
aa/2528_B	yes .
sd/2528_A	i just like i just finished watching that a few minutes ago , .
%/2528_A	um , and it
sd/2528_A	and , that , that 's a interesting one .
sd/2528_A	i , i , i like that , because there 's , there are ,
sd/2528_A	i 've noticed that every , every major station now has their own law show .
sd/2528_A	there 's l a law ,
sd/2528_A	and there 's , um , equal justice , some other one , law and order or something .
qy/2528_A	do you like the law shows
%/2528_A	or ,
ng/2528_B	i really do n't watch that much t v ,
sd/2528_B	what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch ,
sd/2528_B	and then on the nights i can watch , i 'll pick out something .
ba/2528_A	that , that makes logic ,
%/2528_B	but , um ,
sv/2528_A	also saves a lot of time with commercials .
aa/2528_B	you 're not kidding .
qy/2528_B	do you ever watch american gladiators ?
na/2528_A	oh , i have .
sd/2528_A	i 've , i 've , i watched that late , um ,
sd/2528_A	i guess it 's on late saturday nights or something ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2528_B	midnight .
sd/2528_A	that 's entering the day as well .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2528_B	midnight .
qy/2528_A	have you , have , have you seen this often ?
na/2528_B	i tape it .
bh/2528_A	oh , really ?
ny/2528_B	yeah ,
sd/2528_B	i tape it because i do n't stay up that late to watch it ,
b/2528_A	yeah .
sd/2528_B	i tape it .
sd/2528_B	but i understand , uh , that in england , they play it at normal times because they do n't consider that violent ,
sd/2528_B	and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program .
bh/2528_A	really ?
%/2528_A	i ,
sd/2528_B	and , i 'm like , i do n't believe this .
%/2528_A	that do n't ,
sv/2528_A	it , it , it seems like ,
sv/2528_A	i mean , if wrestling is prime time , professional wrestling , it seems like it 's just , just , just like pros in a wrestling to me ,
sv/2528_A	i do n't , i do n't see any difference though ,
aa/2528_B	i do n't either .
sd/2528_A	i , i do n't understand it ,
sd/2528_A	they consider it violent .
%/2528_A	i have so ever ,
sd/2528_A	i have seen it on , where we are ,
sd/2528_A	i live in , uh , rochester , new york ,
%/2528_A	and i think a ,
qy/2528_B	you 're in new york ?
ny/2528_A	yes .
b/2528_B	oh .
qw/2528_A	where are you ?
sd/2528_B	i 'm in dallas , texas .
%/2528_A	you 're , uh ,
sd/2528_A	everybody i speak to is in texas , oh , oh ,
%/2528_A	yeah ,
sd/2528_A	but i 'm , i 'm in new york
sd/2528_A	and , uh , we seem , we seem to have , um ,
sd/2528_A	i think the american gladiators is on sunday afternoons actually around here as well ,
bh/2528_B	oh , really ?
+/2528_A	sometimes .
sd/2528_A	i think it 's been on ,
sd/2528_A	i think i 've seen it during the day .
b/2528_B	oh .
sd/2528_A	definitely seen it do , on , on , during the day down there ,
sv/2528_A	and i do n't think it 's a very violent show ,
sv/2528_A	i think it 's funny .
sv/2528_A	i think it 's a real good concept ,
sv/2528_A	i think it 's something completely new .
aa/2528_B	i think it 's great .
sd/2528_B	i love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else ,
x/2528_A	.
%/2528_B	and competition .
sd/2528_B	i 'm going oh , great , you know ,
sv/2528_B	it 's a , it 's a great role model for everybody .
aa/2528_A	i think so ,
sv/2528_A	i think because people sort of get through , you know , um , i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the , as well as , you know , some mental fitness
sv/2528_A	and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth .
aa/2528_B	oh , yes ,
sd/2528_B	i mean , when i had , uh ,
sd/2528_B	i was watching it , the , first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well , it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities .
sd/2528_B	and , uh , there she was terrific ,
sd/2528_B	she was really terrific .
qy^d/2528_A	well , do n't they take people who have some sort of , um , big abilities like
sd/2528_A	and , and at least they used to when it , when it ,
sd/2528_A	the first ones i saw they had , um , a man on who was , uh , he played college football and almost went pro ,
sd/2528_A	and they had a , a woman who was a black belt in karate
sd/2528_A	and she was the , uh , she was in the junior olympics or something
sd/2528_A	or they seem to have people who have very , very big sports backgrounds .
%/2528_A	to have
sd/2528_A	they , le , leaned away from that sort of ,
sd/2528_B	they hold competitions in los angeles in , um , florida and minneapolis , minnea , um ,
h/2528_B	trying to think of ,
sv/2528_B	i think it 's in four places around the united states .
sd/2528_B	they hold competition
sd/2528_B	and the only requirement is , of course , your skill of passing these tests ,
qy^d/2528_A	oh , that 's how they do it .
na/2528_B	and that 's it .
sd/2528_B	and we had a bar man from here in dallas area that made it .
bh/2528_A	really ?
sd/2528_B	there is a woman that , uh , made ,
sd/2528_B	well , she called herself a craft person
sd/2528_B	so , i 'm not quite sure what she made .
x/2528_A	.
sd/2528_B	and , uh , she made it .
%/2528_B	i mean there is no ,
sv/2528_B	your occupation has nothing to do with it .
b/2528_A	yeah ,
b/2528_A	okay ,
sv/2528_A	i just thought they had some ,
bf/2528_B	strictly your skill .
b/2528_A	yeah ,
sv/2528_A	i thought they had some sort of ,
sd/2528_A	i mean , i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not ,
ba/2528_A	that 's great .
b/2528_B	huhuh .
oo_co_cc/2528_A	but , maybe i 'll try it one day .
x/2528_B	.
sd/2528_A	i 'll get on there one day and see if i can , uh , um ,
qw/2528_A	what , what do they win ,
qy/2528_A	they , they win money i think , do n't they ?
sd/2528_B	i think the last i heard was it 's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars .
bh/2528_A	really ?
ny/2528_B	uhhuh .
ba/2528_A	wow .

sv/2528_A	i , i actually feel the tennis balls would hurt .
sd/2528_B	oh , well , they ,
sv/2528_A	they look like ,
+/2528_B	they come out with a lot of bruises too .
b/2528_A	yeah ,
sv/2528_A	they seem like a tennis ball
sv/2528_A	but it almost does n't look like it 's almost livable
%/2528_A	yeah ,
%/2528_A	the best
sd/2528_A	i , i do n't think i could , i , i could handle those tennis balls .

b/2528_A	uhhuh .
+/2528_B	because that 's another mystery ,
sd/2528_B	and i do n't have to concentrate too hard on them .
sv/2528_A	but , i 'm sure that 's fun .
sd/2528_B	um , most of the lawyer programs like , uh , law and order ,
b/2528_A	uhhuh .
+/2528_B	they 're not on the times that i 've got , that i 've watched because i have n't had t got , t v guide around here in ages .

sd/2528_A	well , they seem to be on later ,
b/2528_B	yeah .
%/2528_A	all ,
sd/2528_A	always right , right before the news is when i catch them .
sd/2528_A	i , i tend to , if nothing else is in the town television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news , and or , or nightline or something , just sort of get a good , you know , a good , a good think for the day .
qy/2528_B	your news is on at eleven ?
ny/2528_A	yes .
qw/2528_A	when is yours on ?

sd/2528_A	ours is on at eleven
sd/2528_A	it , it 's , um , eleven o'clock now here or eleven twentyfive now here in new york .
%/2528_A	um , i think they wo , they do that ,
sv/2528_A	i think they put things on at , um , eleven o'clock here
sd/2528_A	and i think they put it like eleven o'clock , um , california time , like in california
sd/2528_A	but in the middle they sort of , um ,
sd/2528_A	like central time or mountain time they , they push things back .
%/2528_A	so , i was actually , actually
h/2528_A	i 'm not sure
sd/2528_A	, i was in , i was in iowa awhile ago , and noticed that everything was an hour earlier ,
qy/2528_A	so , does your prime time start at seven o'clock ?
nn/2528_B	no ,
sd/2528_B	well , they have it at six
sd/2528_B	and they have it at nine ,
ad/2528_A	wait ,
nn/2528_A	no ,
nn/2528_A	no ,
sd/2528_B	and they have one at ten .
sd/2528_A	not , not even the news
qy/2528_A	but do they have like , um ,
qy/2528_A	do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth , start at seven o'clock ?
%/2528_A	you ,
qy/2528_A	so , like , you know , the regular television shows that are , that are very popular , do they start at ,
h/2528_B	i 'm trying to think .
+/2528_A	seven or , or at eight ?
na/2528_B	both ,
^h/2528_B	um , let 's see they start , um ,
sd/2528_B	evening shade at seven
sd/2528_B	and then it goes to , um ,
t1/2528_B	what is it after evening , um ,
b/2528_A	right ,
sd/2528_A	because that would the eight o'clock here .
sd/2528_B	that 's major dad at eight i think it is .
b/2528_A	yeah ,
sd/2528_A	that , that would all start at , at , um , that would all start at , at eight o'clock here ,
sd/2528_A	that would n't start at seven .
%/2528_A	we have , um ,
sd/2528_A	at seven o'clock we just have , um ,
%/2528_A	the ,
sd/2528_A	they 'll play , you know , they have old reruns of cheers or something from seven to seven thirty , and then something else from seven thirty to eight
b/2528_B	huh .
sd/2528_A	and ours start at , at , at , at eight and end at eleven ,
%/2528_A	that 's why we
sv/2528_A	. i , i would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten .
b/2528_B	yeah ,
sd/2528_B	it 's , it 's stopped around here at ten
sd/2528_B	and it goes into night programs , at that point which could be one of , you know , many different night programs
sd/2528_B	but it goes into night programs .
ba/2528_A	oh , that 's great .
qy/2528_B	but , uh , do you ever watch cheers ?
na/2528_A	oh , all the time .
x/2528_B	.
qy/2528_A	do you watch cheers
ny/2528_B	oh , yeah ,
ny/2528_B	oh , yeah .
%/2528_A	it 's at ,
sd/2528_A	that was actually a big dilemma for me now because , um , cheers , cheers and twin peaks are now on the same time ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2289_A	okay ,
ad/2289_A	we , we can , uh , be recorded while we talk about it .
aa/2289_B	okay ,
qy/2289_B	well is your ,
qy/2289_B	does your city have mandatory , uh , recycling ?
nn/2289_A	no ,
sd/2289_A	we do n't have mandatory .
sv/2289_A	we , actually , we 're kind of slow up here ,
sd/2289_A	and we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer .
sd/2289_A	and it 's all voluntary .
sd/2289_A	so that 's interesting .
qy/2289_A	cities have a mandatory recycling ?
na/2289_B	um , there , there 're some places that are strongly encouraging it ,
sd/2289_B	and that they city will pick it up .
sd/2289_B	that 's been one of the arguments here .
sd/2289_B	i 'm just sitting here looking . we 've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff .
sd/2289_B	but we have to carry it , uh , some distance ,
sd/2289_B	and some places , um , you can sell your , uh , recyclables ,
sd/2289_B	and , for example , our church was collecting newspapers .
b/2289_A	yeah ,
sd/2289_A	when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing .
sd/2289_A	we got like a penny a pound for them .
sd/2289_B	well , it turns out that so much ,
sd/2289_B	the problem in texas is that , uh , they 've got so much paper now from people recycling that they 've got no way to , uh , reprocess it .
ba/2289_A	oh , my ,
sd/2289_B	it requires an ex , it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it ,
sd/2289_B	and so the value has gone down .
sd/2289_B	it turns out it was n't worth for the church to do .
ba/2289_A	oh , i did n't realize ,
sv/2289_A	you would think ,
sv/2289_A	now up here , i , i suppose they send it all back to the mill
sd/2289_A	and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of , uh .
sd/2289_A	actually there is one in northern vermont .
sd/2289_A	so there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here .
sd/2289_A	i did n't think that ,
sv/2289_A	you know , in the large city that if the next recycling , if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away
%/2289_B	well ,
+/2289_A	it 's a lot of money to transport .
b/2289_B	yeah ,
%/2289_B	well see , that 's ,
sd/2289_B	in , in dallas there no plan to build ,
sd/2289_B	i think there , there 's some in east texas there 's some pulp mills ,
sd/2289_B	but , uh , you have to go to houston ,
sd/2289_B	and , it 's interesting ,
sd/2289_B	and then there 's places that will buy metal
sd/2289_B	and they still buy aluminum can and likes that . *can cans ? likes like ?
qh/2289_A	do you have to buy metal ,
sv/2289_A	like copper is a very good one to collect .
sv/2289_A	even aluminum ,
%/2289_A	yeah ,
%/2289_A	so .
qy/2289_B	well , do you do , do you do recycling ?
na/2289_A	uh , we do the recycling ,
sd/2289_A	and our city will pick up our recyclables .
b/2289_B	oh .
sd/2289_A	they have these little blue bins .
sd/2289_A	um , i do n't recycle personally .
sd/2289_A	i , i 'm saying i want to do it ,
sd/2289_A	but , i do n't get a lot of magazines ,
sd/2289_A	i do n't get a ,
sd/2289_A	i do n't buy the newspaper ,
sd/2289_A	but i do have a lot of , uh ,
sd/2289_A	my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart , a lot of different papers and cardboards .
qy/2289_B	well , do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans ?
ny/2289_A	yes ,
sd/2289_A	but we have a bottle return .
sd/2289_A	a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles .
sd/2289_A	we 've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years .
bf/2289_B	oh , so it 's worth taking them back .
sd/2289_B	well , see , we do n't have .
sd/2289_B	we have , we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles .
sv/2289_A	oh , they should definitely get , um , the nickel returnable .
sv/2289_A	it 's great for the kids , because
sd/2289_A	see , a lot of the kids get the money from it ,
sv/2289_A	and it 's great for the boy scouts running around , they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes .
sd/2289_B	oh , that 's it ,
%/2289_B	you 'll , you 'll ,
sd/2289_B	there is a down side to all this , you know , about no good deed going unpunished ,
+/2289_B	that , uh , my mother sells , um , trees that they make paper out of ,
sd/2289_B	and so every time i recycle newspapers , in fact there 's a , there 's a , uh ,
sd/2289_B	kimberly and clark , the makers of kleenex and such
b/2289_A	yeah .
+/2289_B	has a , uh , a big paper mill .
sd/2289_B	in fact i almost went to work for them .
sd/2289_B	i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me .
sd/2289_B	it 's twenty or thirty miles from my house .
sd/2289_B	every time you recycle , that 's one less tree my mother can sell ,
sd/2289_B	and , uh . so , it 's a question should i be diligent and , um ,
^2/2289_A	and recycle .
+/2289_B	and , and recycle , and put my mother out of her livelihood .
b/2289_A	oh , yes ,
ba/2289_A	i see that .
sd/2289_B	but , it 's an interesting point , though , that , you know , everybody 's so anxious to recycle ,
sv/2289_B	and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment ,
%/2289_B	but ,
^2/2289_A	but it takes away employment from the resource
%/2289_A	and its .
sv/2289_B	well , but in general i think it 's a good idea because
aa/2289_A	i do , too .
+/2289_B	like the glass , you ca n't argue that the glass ,
sd/2289_B	it does n't biodegrade , and , and , uh , the plastics obviously ,
sd/2289_A	they do n't either
sv/2289_B	so we might as well recycle those .
b/2289_A	yeah ,
sv/2289_A	like i say , it 's not a very controversial thing .
sv/2289_A	everyone thinks we should do it .
sv/2289_A	it 's just that we 're so lazy ,
sd/2289_A	i mean , like personally , i do n't want to clean my ,
sd/2289_A	i just have can cat food .
sd/2289_A	i do n't want to clean the can and take the label off it , and put it in a separate bin .
b/2289_B	yeah .
sd/2289_A	you know , i 'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash .
sd/2289_B	well , that 's what we 've got .
sd/2289_B	we started about , new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious .
sd/2289_B	well , we took one load over there ,
sd/2289_B	and now we 've got these containers filling up with stuff ,
sd/2289_B	and , you know , it 's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there .
b/2289_A	yeah ,
sd/2289_A	i think i would be like ,
sd/2289_A	when i bring my bottles back . if they 're pretty clean and stuff , so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months ,
sd/2289_A	and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov , and bring them over .
sd/2289_A	now , if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean , like if i washed all the cans and things , i would n't mind if it sat around too much ,
sd/2289_A	but if , if it stunk or something i would n't like doing it .
sd/2289_A	but , um , i produce quite a bit of trash ,
sd/2289_A	my , you know , house ,
sd/2289_A	and i see it ,
sd/2289_A	but i do n't see so much that i can recycle .
b/2289_B	yeah .
sd/2289_A	like i say , it 's a lot of different type paper and cardboard .
sd/2289_A	i 'm not a real plastic person user , but a lot of paper , um , pretty much ,
sd/2289_A	and i do n't know how they sort that .
sd/2289_A	but if , if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles , i would think that i wou , i would have a recycling center .
sd/2289_A	but now , it 's just me and my husband ,
h/2289_A	so , i do n't know .
sv/2289_B	but every little bit helps ,
^q/2289_B	right .
ny/2289_A	yeah ,
sd/2289_A	i know what you 're saying .
sd/2289_A	but we have , we have a very aggressive recycling at work ,
sd/2289_A	and i 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin .
sv/2289_A	see , some people , it 's , the recycle bin is on their way out .
sv/2289_A	instead of carrying your newspapers , when they get done with them at the end of the day , they throw them in the trash .
qy/2289_B	well , do you have separate trash cans at your desk .
nn/2289_A	um , no ,
sd/2289_A	we do n't ,
sd/2289_A	but other , other offices do .
sd/2289_A	they have a box for papers .
sd/2289_B	well , we have , we have one that 's recyclable and , and then for uh , lunch sacks and waste food
sd/2289_B	and they gave us a list of things that are n't re ,
sd/2289_B	and it turns out it 's not so bad .
sd/2289_B	i , i get a lot of reports that , that are covered in plastic or plas , like saran wrap or something , anyway ,
sd/2289_B	and then , uh , cardboard , there 's a few ,
sd/2289_B	it 's interesting that we 're , we 're recycling computer type paper .
b/2289_A	yeah .
sd/2289_B	and , and , uh , one day they 'll pick up , uh ,
sd/2289_B	the cleaning people come through and they 'll pick up recycled paper ,
sd/2289_B	and then the next day they 'll pick up the other ,
%/2289_B	so .
b/2289_A	oh .
sd/2289_B	depending on how much ,
sd/2289_B	you know , and there 's a lot of , actually , it works pretty well ,
sd/2289_B	and then we have a , uh , waste , uh , cans for aluminum in the , in the break areas at work .
sd/2289_A	well , that 's , that 's a really good idea , because , um , like our , uh , fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit .
b/2289_B	yeah .
sv/2289_A	and they 're thinking about putting a deposit on them , because pretty much you have to , you 're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans , where they 're
b/2289_B	yeah ,
+/2289_A	so much easier just to put a deposit on it , because most , probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits , because they 're beer and soda ,
sd/2289_A	but when they sell juice , it 's some strange quirk in the law , you do n't have to have a deposit on it .
sd/2289_A	and even like , the , a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it ,
sd/2289_A	but if it 's got soda in it , it does .
sd/2289_A	so , it 's a strange .
sd/2289_B	that 's an interesting distinction .
b/2289_A	yeah ,
sv/2289_A	they should , they should clean , clear that up .
sd/2289_A	it would n't take them much to put a stamp on the , uh , juice cans as easily as the soda .
b/2289_B	yeah .
sd/2289_A	so , but redemption centers are a big thing up here ,
sd/2289_A	they get a penny a can they handle .
sd/2289_A	they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor .
sv/2289_A	i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can .
sd/2289_B	well , see , well , see , those of us that do n't have state income taxes ,
sd/2289_B	yet
b/2289_A	yeah .
+/2289_B	that 's the big debate here in texas , that the legislature wants to put one in ,
sd/2289_B	and , it 's interesting what people get upset about ,
sd/2289_B	uh , it really is .
qy/2289_A	is bot , is bottle return down there a heated debate ?
nn/2289_B	well , no ,
bk/2289_A	oh , yeah .
sd/2289_A	well , we ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2289_A	well , here you ca n't drink ,
sd/2289_B	we 're not civilized now , you can no longer , you can not drink beer and drive ,
sd/2289_B	but
%/2289_A	well .
+/2289_B	but it was , it was actually legal .
b/2289_A	yes ,
sd/2289_A	well , i know , i was in atlanta ,
sd/2289_A	and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand .
sd/2289_A	but here , let me put that in a paper cup for you .
sd/2289_A	so that was strange .
sv/2289_A	but , i think ,
sv/2289_A	if some people they have ,
sv/2289_A	they say , well , we 're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these , um , the , the recycle center , you have to deal with the can and then you have to , to recycle it ,
sv/2289_A	and , their problem 's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits
b/2289_B	yeah .
+/2289_A	see how they handle it ,
sd/2289_A	and see if it 's a good way ,
sd/2289_A	and then do it that way . because , as , like i say , people are making money on it .
sv/2289_B	well , you know , the other ,
sd/2289_A	the cans do , are worth something .
+/2289_B	well the other thing is , it also is , is a , is a , a good habit , uh , to , uh , just to conserve resources , you know , where they , you know , because you get in the habit of that , you think in terms of , of , uh , of , of things like saving
fp/3189_B	hi , clarice .
qy/3189_B	um , have you had a family reunion recently ?
ny/3189_A	yes ,
sd/3189_A	just this last summer we went back to utah ,
sd/3189_A	and we met , it was my ,
sd/3189_A	we usually go to my family reunion ,
sd/3189_A	but this one was my husband 's
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	and they 're usually quite similar , i think .
qy/3189_B	are you both from utah originally ?
nn/3189_A	no ,
sd/3189_A	he 's from here
bk/3189_B	oh , uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	but , uh , most of his people are from oregon ,
sd/3189_A	so we kind of met halfway
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	and so , this was one ,
sd/3189_A	and they , um , planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin
ba/3189_B	oh , how nice .
+/3189_A	and had , you know ,
sv/3189_A	things like that have to be planned ,
sd/3189_A	like they had planned
sd/3189_A	that , we went to the reunion in end of jul , june and first of july
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
+/3189_A	that part
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
+/3189_A	the fourth of july weekend ,
sd/3189_A	but we had to plan everything like clear in december , january
b/3189_B	sure ,
b/3189_B	sure ,
+/3189_A	to reserve that .
qy/3189_B	now was this his entire family , cousins , aunts , uncles
b/3189_A	uhhuh .
+/3189_B	like that or his immediate family ?
nn/3189_A	no
ba/3189_B	oh , wow .
sd/3189_A	this was everybody .
ba/3189_B	oh wow ,
qw/3189_B	how many people were there ?
sd/3189_A	oh , i , oh , i , jeez , i think over , um , three hundred
ba/3189_B	wow .
+/3189_A	were there .
sd/3189_A	it was quite a large
ba/3189_B	wow .
sd/3189_A	it was a great big lodge ,
sd/3189_A	and so we had plenty of room and everything ,
sd/3189_A	and some of them live in that area ,
sd/3189_A	so it was n't too hard for them to come in the day and leave .
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	but , um , that was a great big thing ,
sd/3189_A	and we do that with his family about every five years ,
+/3189_A	a great big one .
sd/3189_A	and then like immediate family we do , like we try to do one thing once a year .
qw/3189_B	now how many , how many people are in his immediate family ?
sv/3189_A	well , he has eight brothers and sisters
ba/3189_B	oh , wow .
sd/3189_A	so that 's big by itself .
ba/3189_B	wow ,
aa/3189_B	it really is ,
x/3189_A	.
qy^d/3189_B	and you get together once a year .
ny/3189_A	yeah .
ba/3189_B	wow ,
sd/3189_A	so we have a little shindig with them .
qy/3189_B	are they all here in the area ,
qrr/3189_B	or are they
sd/3189_A	um
+/3189_B	scattered ?
+/3189_A	they 're close , in a close proximity .
^h/3189_A	um , let 's see ,
sd/3189_A	there are four of them who live here in texas , and his mom and dad .
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	so , um , the others live in close neighboring , um , states , like nevada , arizona
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
+/3189_A	i think like that ,
%/3189_A	yeah
ba/3189_B	oh wow ,
sd/3189_B	that 's wonderful .
sd/3189_A	so , it 's been fun .
qo/3189_A	how about you ?
sd/3189_B	well , we do n't really get together ,
sd/3189_B	i , i would love to ,
sd/3189_B	and that 's why i checked that i wanted to do that , because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime .
sd/3189_B	um , i have a sister in colorado , and , uh , a sister in upstate new york , and a sister in connecticut , and here i am in texas .
sd/3189_B	so we 're kind of scattered right now .
b/3189_A	uhhuh .
sd/3189_B	and , uh , my , my cousins have a , you know , they put on a family reunion , um , once a year ,
sd/3189_B	but it 's always like the second week in september ,
%/3189_B	so it 's ,
sd/3189_B	the kids are already back in school
b/3189_A	uhhuh .
sd/3189_B	and so , and that 's back in the
ba/3189_A	that 's hard .
sd/3189_B	and that 's in new york ,
sd/3189_B	and there 's no way , i mean there 's
b/3189_A	yeah ,
+/3189_B	just no possible way .
b/3189_A	yeah .
sd/3189_B	and it 's not really a weekend ,
sd/3189_B	it 's just like a day kind of thing , because most of them are , you know , um ,
sd/3189_B	my family moved to connecticut ,
sd/3189_B	the rest of the family stayed in new york
b/3189_A	uhhuh .
+/3189_B	and , uh , on long island ,
sd/3189_B	and so , they 're all kind of local and close ,
sd/3189_B	and so they just have a , you know , a day picnic ,
sd/3189_B	and , uh , i 've always thought it would be so neat , even if it were just my immediate family , to have like a weekend type thing
b/3189_A	yeah .
sd/3189_B	that would be so wonderful .
sd/3189_A	it really is fun ,
sd/3189_A	and my mom 's family does it once a year , just like you said
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	once a year , um , they have a , a , a wednesday through a , a saturday type thing .
sd/3189_A	you can come and go as you please type thing .
ba/3189_B	oh , wow .
sd/3189_A	and they do that once a year .
sd/3189_A	i kind of missed it this year , and felt bad ,
sv/3189_A	but you ca n't go every year ,
sv/3189_A	you just
b/3189_B	yeah ,
b/3189_B	yeah ,
+/3189_A	can not do that .
b/3189_B	yeah .
b/3189_A	um .
qy/3189_B	and do they , they have a hotel ,
qrr/3189_B	or where do you stay ?
sd/3189_A	um , basically , they just stay with each other , brothers or sisters .
sd/3189_A	there are enough in the area to , to just kind of span yourself out .
^2/3189_B	take everybody ,
%/3189_B	yeah .
sd/3189_A	whoever 's mom and dad it is , you usually go and stay with them ,
sd/3189_A	like i go stay with my mother ,
sd/3189_A	and my cousins , they just go stay with their mom and dad , you know
b/3189_B	uhhuh ,
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
+/3189_A	kind of thing .
sd/3189_A	and so it 's not hard in , in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one utah area
b/3189_B	yeah ,
b/3189_B	yeah ,
sd/3189_A	so that 's not hard ,
sd/3189_A	but
ba/3189_B	oh , that sounds so wonderful ,
qh/3189_B	is n't that nice .
+/3189_A	the real planning , that 's the real key
b/3189_B	yeah .
sd/3189_A	and they send out ,
sd/3189_A	my mom 's family now ,
sd/3189_A	this is the first reunion with my husband 's family i 've really been involved with ,
sd/3189_A	but my mom 's family , each brother and sister takes a turn one year ,
sd/3189_A	and that 's how they divide it up
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_B	but then one brother and sister from each family .
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	and each one of them take their turn .
ba/3189_B	oh , wow ,
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
sd/3189_A	and then the , the parent who 's turn it is , the child whose turn it is
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
+/3189_A	her children help her ,
sd/3189_A	like if it was my mother 's turn
ba/3189_B	oh , i see , uhhuh .
+/3189_A	all of us children would help her
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
+/3189_A	put it on
b/3189_B	uhhuh .
+/3189_A	kind of thing .
ba/3189_B	oh , wow ,
b/3189_A	yeah ,
sd/3189_A	and , um , the thing is , that , um , the , the real part is there are two mailings that go out ,
sd/3189_A	and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making ,
