sd/2984_B_6273	there was one when ,
x/2984_A_6274	.
+/2984_B_6275	we , when we bought the house
sd/2984_B_6276	and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one ,
sd/2984_B_6277	but in terms of the fertilizing and , uh ,
x/2984_A_6278	.
+/2984_B_6279	weed control ,
b/2984_A_6280	uhhuh .
+/2984_B_6281	mainly leave that up to them .
qo/2984_B_6282	what about you ?
nn/2984_A_6283	well , no ,
sd/2984_A_6284	i had a lawn service one year ,
sd/2984_A_6285	and i thought phooey , i 'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost
sd/2984_A_6286	and i said , huhuh ,
b/2984_B_6287	yeah .
^q/2984_A_6288	i can do it much cheaper and better .
b/2984_B_6289	yeah .
sd/2984_A_6290	and so what i did , i switched to liquid ,
sd/2984_A_6291	and i do it with an applicator with my hose ,
sd/2984_A_6292	and it 's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over
b/2984_B_6293	yeah .
+/2984_A_6294	the territory .
b/2984_B_6295	yeah .
sd/2984_A_6296	i was surprised how easy it was .
%/2984_B_6297	well .
sd/2984_A_6298	and , i , i thought , well , i 'm going to do this all the time .
ba/2984_B_6299	well , good .
sd/2984_A_6300	so i found , you know ,
sd/2984_A_6301	and i 've got some problems with , uh , two trees in my front yard ,
sd/2984_A_6302	and i took them to a certified , uh , nurseryman the other day ,
b/2984_B_6303	yeah .
qh/2984_A_6304	and do you know what he told me i h , needed to do ?
nn/2984_B_6305	no .
%/2984_A_6306	which is ,
%/2984_A_6307	a ,
sd/2984_A_6308	it 's just unreal .
sd/2984_A_6309	he said i needed to pull every leave off the tree ,
sd/2984_A_6310	and the tree is fifteen feet high ,
sd/2984_A_6311	and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it
sd/2984_A_6312	and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said i should purchase .
x/2984_B_6313	.
sd/2984_A_6314	and i thought , uhhuh , this is , this is unreal ,
^q/2984_A_6315	this is unreal .
b/2984_B_6316	yeah .
sd/2984_A_6317	so , uh , i think i 'll get my soninlaw to do that for me , if he will .
b/2984_B_6318	yeah
qw/2984_B_6319	. what , what , what kind of a ,
qy/2984_B_6320	is this some sort of a disease ,
qrr/2984_B_6321	or is it a pest ?
ny/2984_A_6322	yes ,
sd/2984_A_6323	it 's a disease that it 's got ,
sd/2984_A_6324	and i do n't know ,
qw/2984_B_6325	what ,
+/2984_A_6326	what happened to it , uh ,
sd/2984_A_6327	and then it
+/2984_B_6328	well , what kind
+/2984_A_6329	it , um ,
+/2984_B_6330	what kind of trees are they ?
sd/2984_A_6331	well , one is a maple ,
sd/2984_A_6332	one is , um ,
b/2984_B_6333	huh .
+/2984_A_6334	a maple ,
sd/2984_A_6335	but i would much prefer ,
sd/2984_A_6336	i think it 's not a native texan tree .
b/2984_B_6337	yeah .
sd/2984_A_6338	and , uh , the one that , the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property ,
sd/2984_A_6339	and they do n't ,
x/2984_B_6340	.
+/2984_A_6341	get any care ,
b/2984_B_6342	uhhuh .
sd/2984_A_6343	and they 're cedar elm ,
sd/2984_A_6344	and they 're just beautiful .
b/2984_B_6345	uhhuh
x/2984_B_6346	.
sd/2984_A_6347	so i mean , it , it 's , you know , these things that you pamper ,
sv/2984_A_6348	some people have really a green thumb ,
sd/2984_A_6349	and , you know ,
b/2984_B_6350	yeah .
+/2984_A_6351	and , um , although i do n't have too serious a problem ,
sd/2984_A_6352	but , i do n't know if it was from the , the , the late freezes that were , or the early freezes we had , that caused this tree damage ,
sd/2984_A_6353	and you know , sperry said , you know , that 's what happened to the crepe myrtles ,
b/2984_B_6354	yeah .
+/2984_A_6355	the last two years that , you , we are looking at all the freeze damage from the prior two years .
b/2984_B_6356	yeah .
sd/2984_A_6357	so , i kind of think that maybe that , uh , happened to these large trees that i have .
b/2984_B_6358	yeah .
sd/2984_A_6359	and i really hate to lose them ,
sv/2984_A_6360	but , um , that 's one of the hazards i guess of , uh , having a , a yard .
b/2984_B_6361	yeah ,
b/2984_B_6362	yeah .
%/2984_A_6363	because i ,
sd/2984_B_6364	well , that 's , that 's one thing that we a , we 've had very poor luck with , with , is , in , in our yard is , is trees
b/2984_A_6365	uhhuh .
sd/2984_B_6366	but the , uh , what , what trees were , were there when we moved in ,
x/2984_A_6367	.
+/2984_B_6368	uh , uh , were , had been put in by the developer when he built the house ,
sd/2984_B_6369	and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think .
aa/2984_A_6370	right ,
sv/2984_A_6371	the quick growing ,
%/2984_A_6372	yeah ,
%/2984_A_6373	and they , and he ,
sd/2984_B_6374	and , uh , figured up last night , at ,
sd/2984_B_6375	there were seven different trees of , of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in ,
sd/2984_B_6376	and we got one left at this point ,
sd/2984_B_6377	but , uh , a couple of them we 've lost to , the , w , were n't too good trees , we 've lost to wind , uh , uh .
b/2984_A_6378	uh , uhhuh
x/2984_A_6379	.
sd/2984_B_6380	three we , three we 've lost to , to , uh , freezes between , uh , eightythree and uh , and then , uh , a year ago we lost , uh , another one .
ad/2984_A_6381	can i pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees ?
%/2984_A_6382	did ,
qy/2984_A_6383	are they still there ,
qy/2984_A_6384	did you cut them down at the , at the ground level ,
qrr/2984_A_6385	or did you pull them ,
x/2984_B_6386	.
+/2984_A_6387	up by the roots ,
qy/2984_A_6388	or how did you get rid of them ?
%/2984_A_6389	because if i
%/2984_B_6390	well , d ,
sd/2984_A_6391	i , i do n't know how to get rid of these big trees , because one has a circumference of about ten inches ,
%/2984_A_6392	and ,
b/2984_B_6393	yeah ,
sd/2984_B_6394	we , we did n't ha , we did n't have any that were that ,
b/2984_A_6395	oh .
+/2984_B_6396	that big when they , uh , went .
sd/2984_B_6397	two o , two of them , uh , the wind , the wind blew over
%/2984_A_6398	uh .
+/2984_B_6399	uh , in , in terms of getting them down .
b/2984_A_6400	uhhuh .
%/2984_B_6401	uh
sd/2984_A_6402	because i do n't want
+/2984_B_6403	the ,
+/2984_A_6404	stubs in my lawn .
sd/2984_A_6405	because
b/2984_B_6406	yeah .
+/2984_A_6407	you still have to ,
b/2984_B_6408	yeah .
sd/2984_B_6409	now th , the one that , the one that we lost , the last one that we lost a , a year ago
b/2984_A_6410	uhhuh .
+/2984_B_6411	uh , u , up until then , they do , had n't been big enough
sd/2984_B_6412	but what i just used a hand saw and sawed them off at , at ,
^2/2984_A_6413	the base ?
+/2984_B_6414	as close ,
^2/2984_A_6415	to the ground ?
+/2984_B_6416	close to ground level as i could ,
b/2984_A_6417	uhhuh .
+/2984_B_6418	and then , uh , got s ,
^2/2984_A_6419	bore ?
+/2984_B_6420	got some chemical that drill holes and pour in that helps ,
bf/2984_A_6421	i see
+/2984_B_6422	helps rot the ,
+/2984_A_6423	tr ,
bf/2984_A_6424	uh , a stump killer .
b^m/2984_B_6425	stump ki , yeah ,
b/2984_A_6426	yeah .
+/2984_B_6427	stump killer , and stump , stump rotter ,
b/2984_A_6428	uhhuh .
sd/2984_B_6429	but , uh , this last one had a fair sized root
sd/2984_B_6430	and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood , uh ,
sd/2984_B_6431	and , and saw it and stopped in and asked ,
x/2984_A_6432	.
+/2984_B_6433	if i did n't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirtyfive bucks ,
sd/2984_B_6434	and i said fine .
sd/2984_B_6435	he had , he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that ,
%/2984_B_6436	and it
b/2984_A_6437	yeah ,
sd/2984_A_6438	and they get that saw ,
sd/2984_A_6439	and i think it 's a , k , some kind of a s , a screwing thing that just rips it right out .
b/2984_B_6440	yeah ,
sd/2984_B_6441	and it , it just , it just ripped it
^2/2984_A_6442	right out ,
%/2984_A_6443	yeah .
+/2984_B_6444	right out ,
sd/2984_B_6445	and , uh , i took the ,
sd/2984_B_6446	i , it left the , it left , he left the chips ,
sd/2984_B_6447	and i put them up

sd/2984_B_6453	and ,
b/2984_A_6454	uhhuh .
+/2984_B_6455	and it 's filling in with , with grass , uh , nicely this year , so that , that was , that was worth it
%/2984_B_6456	but , uh ,
bf/2984_A_6457	a blessing in disguise .
aa/2984_B_6458	yeah .

x/2875_B_7737	.
+/2875_A_7738	we want here .
x/2875_B_7739	.
sd/2875_A_7740	i want a rolls royce and a cadillac .
ba/2875_B_7741	hey ,
sv/2875_B_7742	that sounds like a great deal to me .
sv/2875_B_7743	you have great aspirations .
x/2875_A_7744	.
^h/2875_B_7745	well , let 's see
sd/2875_B_7746	i , we just bought , uh , a seventythree mercedes that we have restored
ba/2875_A_7747	oh , that 's great .
sd/2875_A_7748	i 'm ,
%/2875_B_7749	and it ,
+/2875_A_7750	i 'm a hobbyist too ,
sd/2875_A_7751	i like to work on cars too .
b/2875_B_7752	yeah ,
sd/2875_B_7753	it has really been a lot of fun .
sd/2875_B_7754	uh , we found some guys that actually , you know , worked for a mercedes dealership
sd/2875_B_7755	and , uh , they also repair them for other the people on their off time
ba/2875_A_7756	oh , that 's good .
+/2875_B_7757	so have , we , we have redone that thing from stem to stern , i mean inside , outside , you know , we 've redone the body , repainted it , detailed it , so , you know , i really have n't thought much past that it seems like , you know ,
sd/2875_B_7758	i do n't know if i 'll ever want another new car again ,
%/2875_A_7759	was you ,
sd/2875_A_7760	why they , they did n't ,
+/2875_B_7761	you know .
sd/2875_A_7762	say buy it
sd/2875_A_7763	they did n't necessarily say buy it new they just said ,
aap_am/2875_B_7764	maybe not .
+/2875_A_7765	what would you buy , you know .
aa/2875_B_7766	yeah ,
aa/2875_B_7767	that 's true .
sd/2875_B_7768	i , i do n't know it just seems like , uh , you know , for what we 've put into it i feel like that 's something that might retain it 's value a little bit more ,
aa/2875_A_7769	oh , sure ,
+/2875_B_7770	than , you know ,
sv/2875_A_7771	a restored ,
b/2875_B_7772	yeah ,
b/2875_B_7773	yeah ,
b/2875_B_7774	yeah ,
+/2875_A_7775	vehicle is , is great ,

+/2875_A_7777	i think ,
b/2875_B_7778	yeah ,
+/2875_A_7779	certainly if it 's an old mercedes will be good .
aa/2875_B_7780	right ,
sd/2875_B_7781	we , the one thing that , uh , we did decide as , it 's , it 's ,
sd/2875_B_7782	we wanted it to be as authentic as possible
sd/2875_B_7783	but we did break down and put a c d player in it ,
x/2875_A_7784	.
x/2875_B_7785	.
ba/2875_A_7786	well , that 's great .

+/2875_B_7862	you know , even though right now i 'm not driving an american car ,

b/2875_B_7875	yeah ,
b/2875_B_7876	yeah .
sd/2875_A_7877	but , uh , i do look for a one year old vehicle ,
b/2875_B_7878	uhhuh .
+/2875_A_7879	with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles ,
b/2875_B_7880	yeah ,
b^m/2875_B_7881	twenty thousand ,
b/2875_B_7882	yeah ,
+/2875_A_7883	whatever .
b/2875_B_7884	yeah .
sd/2875_B_7885	well , that 's what my parents are avid cadillac freaks .
%/2875_B_7886	they had , uh ,
sd/2875_B_7887	and i think my , my mother drives the seville now that 's , uh , i guess it 's a couple of years old ,
sd/2875_B_7888	and , uh , she had a seville before that that had the odd backs that was ,
ba/2875_A_7889	oh , yeah ,
sd/2875_A_7890	i remember those .
+/2875_B_7891	that was so , uh ,
%/2875_B_7892	yeah ,
%/2875_B_7893	yeah ,
sd/2875_B_7894	and she , it final just wore out
sd/2875_B_7895	they had , they had purchased it ,
sd/2875_B_7896	i do n't , ca n't remember how many years they had that car ,
sd/2875_B_7897	but she loved the styling of it .
sv/2875_A_7898	that she may want to save , if she , she does n't have it anymore .
ar/2875_B_7899	no ,
sd/2875_B_7900	she sold it
%/2875_B_7901	and she ,
%/2875_A_7902	that ,
sv/2875_A_7903	since they do n't make them anymore ,
b/2875_B_7904	yeah .
+/2875_A_7905	she , that could be turned into a classic ,
aa/2875_B_7906	i know .
+/2875_A_7907	in , in ten , fifteen years , uh .
aa/2875_B_7908	yeah ,
sd/2875_B_7909	she kept telling herself that
sd/2875_B_7910	and it 's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well , just let me take it down there and find out what 's wrong with it ,
sd/2875_B_7911	i mean he came back with a new car .
b/2875_A_7912	no ,
bf/2875_A_7913	he wanted new one ,
b/2875_A_7914	yeah ,
b/2875_A_7915	right ,
b/2875_A_7916	yeah .
aa/2875_B_7917	yeah ,
sd/2875_B_7918	i think he had an ulterior motive
sd/2875_B_7919	he could just see , you know , dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went
sd/2875_B_7920	but , uh , they , they really are nice cars , there , there ,
sd/2875_A_7921	i 'm still a full size person ,
b/2875_B_7922	yeah .
sd/2875_A_7923	and i like a full size cadillac ,
sd/2875_A_7924	i , i want one of those ,
sd/2875_A_7925	i think they are , i do n't know , a classic
sv/2875_A_7926	but they 're ,
b/2875_B_7927	uhhuh .
+/2875_A_7928	certainly not ,
sd/2875_A_7929	they have n't changed in about , uh , twenty years ,
sv/2875_A_7930	and ,
b/2875_B_7931	yeah ,
b/2875_B_7932	yeah .
+/2875_A_7933	and they 'll eventually phase them out
sd/2875_A_7934	and i sure would like one ever those , uh , uh , within the next five years ,
b/2875_B_7935	yeah ,
+/2875_A_7936	or so .
sv/2875_B_7937	it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again , you know ,
b/2875_A_7938	right .
sd/2875_B_7939	they had , they 've scaled everything down so much
sd/2875_B_7940	and , uh , i have , i do n't , i 've never owned a really large car ,
h/2875_B_7941	i do n't know ,
sd/2875_B_7942	i think that cougar was the biggest thing i ever had
%/2875_B_7943	and ,
sd/2875_A_7944	well , even the japanese cars are bigger too
%/2875_A_7945	but , uh ,
b/2875_B_7946	yeah ,
sd/2875_A_7947	i 've never had a jap ,
sv/2875_B_7948	now the lexus are very nice looking cars ,
sd/2875_A_7949	i 've never had ,
+/2875_B_7950	you know .
+/2875_A_7951	a japanese car ,
sd/2875_A_7952	i , i 've had friends who had them ,
b/2875_B_7953	uhhuh .
sv/2875_A_7954	and i think they 're a lot over ra ,
sv/2875_A_7955	and they 're is just no styling to them ,
sv/2875_A_7956	you ca n't tell one japanese car from the other ,
aa/2875_B_7957	that 's true ,
+/2875_A_7958	because they all a like ,
aa/2875_B_7959	that 's true .
sd/2875_A_7960	you know , i do n't mean that as a joke ,
sd/2875_A_7961	i mean ,
b/2875_B_7962	yeah .
+/2875_A_7963	they really all look a like ,
b/2875_B_7964	yeah .
%/2875_A_7965	and the
sd/2875_A_7966	i do n't have any idea what , which car it is ,
bf/2875_B_7967	what is what ,
b/2875_B_7968	yeah .
+/2875_A_7969	until i look at it to see what it is ,
b/2875_B_7970	uhhuh ,
b/2875_B_7971	uhhuh .
sv/2875_A_7972	and i think they have not , uh , lead the field in styling ,
sd/2875_A_7973	they do have sports cars
b/2875_B_7974	yeah .
sd/2875_A_7975	but the price is way more ,
sd/2875_A_7976	you can get a cadillac for ,
b/2875_B_7977	uhhuh ,
b/2875_B_7978	uhhuh .
+/2875_A_7979	the same price as you can get a small japanese ,
b/2875_B_7980	yeah ,
b/2875_B_7981	yeah .
+/2875_A_7982	car ,
sv/2875_A_7983	it 's ridiculous now .

b/2875_A_7987	uhhuh .
+/2875_B_7988	you know ,
sd/2875_B_7989	i guess it just , uh , it seems to me they 're all the same shape .
sd/2875_B_7990	i have a very good friend that has a buick regal
sd/2875_B_7991	and she , she 's had , she 's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it
sd/2875_B_7992	and that 's what she 's going to buy again
sd/2875_B_7993	and i 'm like , oh , please , it looks exactly the same as this old one that you 've got
sv/2875_B_7994	and ,
b/2875_A_7995	yeah .
+/2875_B_7996	so i guess it 's in the eyes of the beholder ,
aa/2875_A_7997	oh , yeah .
+/2875_B_7998	i suppose .
aa/2875_A_7999	yeah ,

qy/2875_B_8012	what they have out for like the next year , is everything still pretty square ,
sv/2875_B_8013	it seems like the cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really , i , i ca n't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the alliance .
nn/2875_A_8014	oh , no ,

sd/2875_A_8057	they had several futuristic cars .
ba/2875_B_8058	that 's wild ,
b/2875_A_8059	yeah .
+/2875_B_8060	you know ,
sd/2875_B_8061	you hear about things like that
sv/2875_B_8062	and you think that ca n't possibly be done ,
sv/2875_B_8063	i mean , it just ,
aa/2875_A_8064	i know .
+/2875_B_8065	that 's just too weird .
sd/2875_A_8066	and i like engines

bf/2875_B_8073	so you could tell ,
bf/2875_B_8074	see the inside of them or whatever .
aa/2875_A_8075	yeah ,
b/2875_B_8076	yeah .
sd/2875_A_8077	but , uh , that , that sold me in buying a new car , you know ,
sd/2875_A_8078	i mean , certainly interested in buying a new car
sd/2875_A_8079	but again the , yeah , the american cars were for superior in styling and ,
b/2875_B_8080	yeah ,
b/2875_B_8081	yeah ,
+/2875_A_8082	new engines ,
aap_am/2875_B_8083	well , maybe ,
sv/2875_A_8084	and , uh ,
sv/2875_B_8085	somebody 's finally woken up , you know .
+/2875_A_8086	i thing so , because they 've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while * spelling `` think '' ?
sd/2875_A_8087	and ,
b/2875_B_8088	yeah .
+/2875_A_8089	i think that , i , i would definitely buy ,
sd/2875_A_8090	again there 's the question are we in the market , uh ,
b/2875_B_8091	yeah .
sd/2875_A_8092	and i could buy anything , you know .
aa/2875_B_8093	oh , yeah ,
sd/2875_B_8094	you know , if i could fine , * spelling `` find '' ?
sd/2875_B_8095	i , i was really crazy about jags for a while
sd/2875_B_8096	and the convertible , had a is it x j s or something like that ,
sd/2875_B_8097	and i ,
b/2875_A_8098	yeah ,
b/2875_A_8099	yeah .
+/2875_B_8100	you know , thought that 's a dream car ,
sv/2875_B_8101	and , and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant , you know .
sd/2875_A_8102	well , i have n't work on them myself so i do n't , that , you know , my cars do n't go to the shop , you know ,
b/2875_B_8103	yeah ,
%/2875_A_8104	so , uh ,
b/2875_B_8105	yeah .
sd/2875_A_8106	i am the kind of engineer
sd/2875_A_8107	and i 've always done it myself
sd/2875_A_8108	and , uh
sv/2875_B_8109	well , that 's good that you can .
+/2875_A_8110	i 've got three of them
sd/2875_A_8111	and , uh , i ca n't remember one ,
sd/2875_A_8112	i think i had one someone welded a muffler on for me ,
b/2875_B_8113	oh , really ,
%/2875_B_8114	that ,
+/2875_A_8115	in a years time ,
ba/2875_B_8116	oh , gosh ,
ba/2875_B_8117	that 's great .
sd/2875_A_8118	i think that 's the only thing of the three vehicles that i 've in it just the welding on
sd/2875_A_8119	like i said i do n't do that you know .
sv/2875_B_8120	i think it takes a talent to do that , you know ,
sd/2875_B_8121	my , my husband is , uh , engineer
sd/2875_B_8122	but he can not , i mean ,
sd/2875_B_8123	or maybe he 's just does n't want to mess with it
sd/2875_B_8124	that 's might be part of it ,
sd/2875_B_8125	but , uh , you know , we just , i just say forget it we 'll just take it in ,
b/2875_A_8126	yeah .

ny/3007_B_8616	yes ,
sd/3007_B_8617	i 've had , i have had a number of them in my lifetime
%/3007_B_8618	and i 've ,
sd/3007_B_8619	i am a golden retriever fan ,
b/3007_A_8620	oh .
sd/3007_B_8621	but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry .
b/3007_A_8622	oh .
b/3007_B_8623	yes .
b/3007_B_8624	yes .
bf/3007_A_8625	instead of being carried .
aa/3007_B_8626	yes ,
sd/3007_B_8627	well , they were ,
sd/3007_B_8628	they really wanted something teeny tiny ,
sd/3007_B_8629	and i , uh , really wanted that retriever 's disposition .
b/3007_A_8630	yeah .
+/3007_B_8631	uh , the ultimate to tolerant , trainable disposition ,
b/3007_A_8632	really .
sd/3007_B_8633	so i called four or five dog trainers because i do n't like the little dogs .
b/3007_A_8634	uhhuh .
sd/3007_B_8635	and , and i asked them , you know , these are the ages of the kids , what do i get .
sd/3007_B_8636	and they all said , golden retriever
sd/3007_B_8637	and i said okay ,
x/3007_A_8638	.
+/3007_B_8639	put it under twenty pounds .
sd/3007_B_8640	and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frize which is a ,
b/3007_A_8641	huh .
qy/3007_B_8642	do you know what that is ?
ny/3007_A_8643	yes ,
sd/3007_A_8644	i 've seen those .
sv/3007_A_8645	they 're cute .
sv/3007_B_8646	they 're cute .
sv/3007_B_8647	they look like an air headed let me tell you .
sv/3007_B_8648	they 're calm , they 're not yuppie , they 're trainable , they 're , uh , very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is .
sv/3007_B_8649	they 're not dignified like a retriever can be .
b/3007_A_8650	uhhuh .
b/3007_B_8651	yeah .
qw/3007_B_8652	so how old is your retriever ?
sd/3007_A_8653	oh , she 's about four .
sd/3007_A_8654	she 's not completely pure .
sd/3007_A_8655	we got her from the , uh , humane society when she was a puppy .
sd/3007_A_8656	she looks like a gol ,
sd/3007_A_8657	she looks just like a golden retriever ,
sd/3007_A_8658	but she 's a little bit smaller .
sd/3007_A_8659	she 's like fiftyfive pounds .
sd/3007_B_8660	well , actually , you know , that 's the breed standard for females .
%/3007_B_8661	what you ,
qy/3007_A_8662	is it ?
ny/3007_B_8663	yeah ,
sd/3007_B_8664	what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers , this , you know , plus eighty to a hundred pound range .
b/3007_A_8665	uhhuh .
sd/3007_B_8666	that is not breed standard .
b/3007_A_8667	huh .
sd/3007_B_8668	fiftyfive is the minimum
sd/3007_B_8669	but they usually run about sixty to sixtyfive .
sd/3007_B_8670	and the ones that are shown , they are inside that weight allowance .
b/3007_A_8671	uhhuh .
sd/3007_B_8672	you can not show your retriever if it 's , you know , a hundred plus pounds .
b/3007_A_8673	oh , huh .
ad/3007_B_8674	so do n't say she 's small ,
b/3007_A_8675	yeah .
+/3007_B_8676	just say she 's perfect .
b^m/3007_A_8677	she 's perfect .
sd/3007_A_8678	well , she 's got a brown nose instead of black too .
b/3007_B_8679	uhhuh .
sd/3007_A_8680	which makes her , i guess , unshowable ,
aa/3007_B_8681	yep .
+/3007_A_8682	even if she had papers which she does n't
sd/3007_A_8683	but , but we love her anyway .
sd/3007_A_8684	she 's just a lot of company to us .
%/3007_A_8685	we did n't ,
sd/3007_A_8686	we have n't had any kids
sd/3007_A_8687	and we 're expecting a baby this summer ,
sd/3007_A_8688	but up until then , she 's been our substitute kid
sd/3007_A_8689	and she was a lot of fun .
sd/3007_B_8690	well , they are , they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog ,
b/3007_A_8691	right .
+/3007_B_8692	because i had a retriever , actually i had a retriever irish setter cross .
b/3007_A_8693	oh .
+/3007_B_8694	which is a really nice animal
sd/3007_B_8695	and fortunately it was just like a retriever
sd/3007_B_8696	and then i 've had a retriever .
sd/3007_A_8697	i bet it had a pretty coat too .
sd/3007_B_8698	it was gorgeous .
sd/3007_B_8699	it was just gorgeous . i mean just gorgeous .
sd/3007_B_8700	um , and they both , you know ,
sd/3007_B_8701	both the half breed and the pure breed had the , uh , what i consider the , the , the perfect disposition .
qh/3007_B_8702	but you know what , you know what scares me about golden retrievers ?
sd/3007_B_8703	since they 've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders .
+/3007_B_8704	which is probably where yours came from . people that do n't know what they 're doing , and they breed them , you know , for a certain characteristic .
sd/3007_B_8705	and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big , for somehow big is perceived as the better .
sd/3007_B_8706	and when you start doing that you really tamper with , you know , the , all the , the years of , uh , culling litters
sd/3007_B_8707	and , and , uh , you tamper with what the dog innately is .
b/3007_A_8708	yeah .
%/3007_B_8709	we w ,
%/3007_B_8710	when i was ,
sd/3007_B_8711	when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like a retriever , you know , the short to the ground , stocky , golden , uh , trainable , tractable , quiet
b/3007_A_8712	right .
+/3007_B_8713	animal that could hunt and still be in the house .
sd/3007_B_8714	and i ended up getting one that , uh , came out of a , a , a hunting stock
b/3007_A_8715	oh .
+/3007_B_8716	because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did .
sd/3007_B_8717	and i 've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb ,
x/3007_A_8718	.
+/3007_B_8719	dumb retrievers
sd/3007_B_8720	and i 'm , and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed ,
b/3007_A_8721	yeah .
sd/3007_B_8722	but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it 's going to be ruined .
sd/3007_A_8723	we have some friends with a brother and sister golden retriever
sd/3007_A_8724	and those dogs have been having seizures ,
sd/3007_A_8725	and i wonder since both of them are having them if it 's some kind of breeding
aa/3007_B_8726	oh , yeah .
+/3007_A_8727	problem .
aa/3007_B_8728	you bet you .
aa/3007_B_8729	you bet you .
qy^d/3007_B_8730	you know how they came up with the retriever , do n't you , the golden ?
nn/3007_A_8731	huhuh .
sd/3007_B_8732	it was bred out of several different retrievers ,
sd/3007_B_8733	and they bred it for companionship and , uh , uh , disposition and , and ability to hunt .
sd/3007_B_8734	it was kept only by kings .
b/3007_A_8735	oh .
sd/3007_B_8736	but they selectively culled those litters , i mean , for many hundreds of years
sd/3007_B_8737	and since it slept in the castle with its master , i mean it had , it had to be of a disposition to make it , you know , an animal you could keep around that closely .
sd/3007_B_8738	but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect .
sd/3007_B_8739	now , you know , that seems like a cruel thing to do .
b/3007_A_8740	yeah .
sv/3007_B_8741	on the other hand , you sure , you know , they sure created a , a wonderful breed ,
aa/3007_A_8742	yeah .
sv/3007_A_8743	they did .
+/3007_B_8744	i mean a wonderful breed .
sd/3007_A_8745	i , i had never really had a golden retriever before .
sd/3007_A_8746	we were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband 's family had had shepherds
%/3007_A_8747	and all the other ,
sd/3007_A_8748	we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies were n't very , uh , social and stuff .
b/3007_B_8749	uhhuh .
sd/3007_A_8750	and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs
sd/3007_A_8751	and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down .
sd/3007_A_8752	and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling .
sd/3007_A_8753	and that ,
sd/3007_B_8754	well , i tell you ,
+/3007_A_8755	was mine .
+/3007_B_8756	you know the , the german shepherd is the classic case of what i 'm talking about because in america that 's called a rin tin tin phenomena .
b/3007_A_8757	uhhuh .
sd/3007_B_8758	only in america is there a dog called a german shepherd .
bh/3007_A_8759	oh , really ?
sd/3007_B_8760	that dog is bred out of three european dogs . the belgian tervurien , a german skutzhund , and a , i always forget the third one . i can see it .
%/3007_B_8761	uh , uh , i ,
sd/3007_B_8762	but the third one is a children 's dog .
b/3007_A_8763	oh .
sd/3007_B_8764	and there are distinct breeds in europe .
sd/3007_B_8765	now what happened over here was is that people saw the , the first , um , which would actually have been a skutzhund which is what rin tin tin was .
b/3007_A_8766	uhhuh .
sd/3007_B_8767	and everybody wanted rin tin tin .
x/3007_A_8768	.
sd/3007_B_8769	and it was known as a german shepherd here .
sd/3007_B_8770	so they created a breed standard . the american kennel club did .
b/3007_A_8771	oh .
sd/3007_B_8772	that said anything that is a skutzhund , a , a tervurien and , uh , alsatian that 's the other one . alsatian , any inner breeding of that can be called a german shepherd here .
b/3007_A_8773	huh .
sd/3007_B_8774	and what happened is , is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect .
sd/3007_B_8775	and they bred a dog that i th , it 's called a , an animal 's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you .
x/3007_A_8776	.
sd/3007_B_8777	that german shepherd , the american german shepherd here was a , a , a such an unreliable animal that the american seeing eye institute
b/3007_A_8778	uhhuh .
+/3007_B_8779	refused to use them ,
b/3007_A_8780	huh .
+/3007_B_8781	because they would turn on th , on their handlers .
b/3007_A_8782	uhhuh .
sd/3007_B_8783	and even , um , uh , police corps which started , you know , finding other breeds to use because this thing , this , this thing known as a german shepherd here , its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible .
sd/3007_B_8784	so about fifteen years ago the german shepherd club of america decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this .
sd/3007_B_8785	so they went back to europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds
b/3007_A_8786	uhhuh .
+/3007_B_8787	and bred to a standard what they wanted an american german shepherd to be . which is a very heavily now skutzhund and alsatian ,
sd/3007_B_8788	and it 's the alsatian that 's the kid 's dog .
%/3007_B_8789	it 's just ,
sd/3007_B_8790	you see them in europe
sv/3007_B_8791	and they 're just lovely .
b/3007_A_8792	huh .
sd/3007_B_8793	but you 'll see ,
sd/3007_B_8794	i mean , if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for german shepherds , they will say on them , bred for disposition , a k c conforming
b/3007_A_8795	huh .
+/3007_B_8796	which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog .
sd/3007_B_8797	this is bred for ,
sd/3007_B_8798	and they had to go through and destroy a , for a while there , about seventyfive percent of their puppies that they bred .
ba/3007_A_8799	wow .
sd/3007_B_8800	because they were looking for this disposition .
sd/3007_B_8801	and nowadays you , you 'll get , you 'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific , you know , breeder handler .
sd/3007_B_8802	they will recommend their shepherds as a children 's dog .
b/3007_A_8803	huh .
%/3007_B_8804	but ...

sd/2761_B_29869	i just got married .
+/2761_A_29870	you have been to some family reunions , perhaps .
na/2761_B_29871	right ,
sd/2761_B_29872	every four years on one side of my family they plan on having , uh , like my p , grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids .
qw/2761_A_29873	now how long in advance do they , uh , let them know ?
arp_nd/2761_B_29874	well , we plan on it ,
sd/2761_B_29875	it 's like the third weekend in august ,
bk/2761_A_29876	uhhuh .
sd/2761_B_29877	so it 's every four years
%/2761_B_29878	and so ,
bf/2761_A_29879	so they all know it .
aa/2761_B_29880	yeah
sd/2761_B_29881	and then , you know , arrangements are made like during the summer for you know , um , food and who 's , who 's staying where , because a lot of people fro , are from down here , in texas .
b/2761_A_29882	uhhuh ,
b/2761_A_29883	uhhuh .
sd/2761_B_29884	and , uh , a lot of my family is in indiana .
sd/2761_B_29885	that 's where i 'm originally from .
b/2761_A_29886	yes .
sd/2761_B_29887	so , um , we usually meet like at my uncle 's cottage in the , um , at the lake and , uh , make a couple days of it .
ba/2761_A_29888	well that sounds like fun ,
qy/2761_A_29889	do they all have the small children too , that come ?
ny/2761_B_29890	yeah ,
sd/2761_B_29891	pretty much .
qy^d/2761_A_29892	so all ages .
ny/2761_B_29893	yeah
sd/2761_B_29894	and , uh , you know , there 's some my age
sd/2761_B_29895	and then there are some a lot younger , an , about four generations , i guess .
sd/2761_A_29896	well my husband has , uh , on one side has an extended family ,
b/2761_B_29897	uhhuh .
sd/2761_A_29898	and they do n't ever plan it li , as , like you do .
b/2761_B_29899	uhhuh .
sv/2761_A_29900	i think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind
sd/2761_A_29901	so they have to start talking about it , or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody ,
b/2761_B_29902	uhhuh .
+/2761_A_29903	because they 're rather socially active too .
b/2761_B_29904	yeah .
sd/2761_A_29905	and so it has , it seems by doing it about six months ahead , they can pretty much get everybody there .
sd/2761_A_29906	if they do n't , you know , they 'll say , oh we 're planning to go so and so that , go to , to a certain place that weekend with somebody else
^q/2761_A_29907	and we 're already locked in
sd/2761_A_29908	but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them .
b/2761_B_29909	uhhuh .
sd/2761_A_29910	my family , uh , my parents are the youngest of very large families .
b/2761_B_29911	oh .
sd/2761_A_29912	therefore , they do n't have many people left .
b/2761_B_29913	yeah .
sd/2761_A_29914	and , uh , the few previous ones i 've had , uh ,
sd/2761_A_29915	i have n't known many of those people ,
sd/2761_A_29916	but , uh , in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family
sd/2761_A_29917	and that 's been very nice ,
%/2761_A_29918	with , uh ,
sd/2761_A_29919	i have one sister ,
b/2761_B_29920	uhhuh .

b/2761_B_29923	oh .

b/2761_B_29925	yeah .
sd/2761_A_29926	and that 's kind of nice because my husband 's family reunions are so large ,

sd/2761_B_29977	i mean i 've been married now for about nine months
sv/2761_B_29978	so that was another milestone , i guess .
aa/2761_A_29979	yes ,
aa/2761_A_29980	well i 'm sure ,
qy^d/2761_A_29981	and ha , then all of your family probably has not met your husband .

sd/2761_A_30006	uhhuh , getting through to anybody .
sd/2761_A_30007	sometimes i call off and on all day ,
b/2761_B_30008	huh .

x/2761_B_30010	.
sd/2761_A_30011	but i got off that .
fc/2761_B_30012	well we 've kind of exhausted everything i guess .
fc/2761_A_30013	yes ,
fc/2761_A_30014	well , um , i think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes .
fc/2761_B_30015	oh , okay .
fc/2761_A_30016	and , uh , uh , we both look forward to going to our next reunions , i 'm sure .
fc/2761_B_30017	oh yeah .
fc/2761_A_30018	but it has been fun talking to you .
fc/2761_B_30019	well you too .
fc/2761_A_30020	thank you .
fc/2761_B_30021	and maybe i 'll talk to you again .
fc/2761_A_30022	okay ,
fc/2761_A_30023	good .
fc/2761_B_30024	okay ,
fc/2761_B_30025	byebye .
fc/2761_A_30026	byebye .
qo/4801_A_30832	what do you think about capital punishment ?
sd/4801_B_30833	well , i 'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes .
b/4801_A_30834	yeah .
qw/4801_A_30835	which crimes do you feel that ?
sv/4801_B_30836	well , i think first degree murder , uh , probably warrants it .
aa/4801_A_30837	yeah .
%/4801_A_30838	because of ,
sd/4801_A_30839	so many times it 's so brutal and just recurrent
aa/4801_B_30840	right .
sv/4801_A_30841	selling , i think should also .
aa/4801_B_30842	exactly .
sv/4801_B_30843	recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or
b/4801_A_30844	yeah .
+/4801_B_30845	whatever .
sd/4801_B_30846	i come from a state that has , well i originally come from the state that has , uh , the death penalty .
sd/4801_B_30847	i come from florida .
b/4801_A_30848	uhhuh .
sd/4801_B_30849	and , uh , they 're pretty liberal on it .
sd/4801_B_30850	they tend to , like , fry people left and right .
b/4801_A_30851	yeah
%/4801_A_30852	that 's ,
+/4801_B_30853	which ,
ad/4801_B_30854	go ahead .
ad/4801_A_30855	go ahead .
sd/4801_A_30856	texas is too .
sd/4801_A_30857	texas , i saw on t v the other night , is the , has had fortysix in like the past several years .
b/4801_B_30858	yeah .
sd/4801_A_30859	so they 're pretty hip on it too , i guess .
sd/4801_A_30860	they do it by lethal injection , at huntsville .
b/4801_B_30861	yeah ,
b/4801_B_30862	okay .
sd/4801_B_30863	i think florida still uses electric chair .
aa/4801_A_30864	yeah .
h/4801_B_30865	uh , i do n't , i do n't know .
sv/4801_B_30866	in some ways i do n't like it because it 's like they 're playing god .
b/4801_A_30867	yeah .
sv/4801_B_30868	and that 's not ,
sd/4801_B_30869	i do n't think that 's right .
sv/4801_B_30870	but on the other hand , there 's a lot of advantages to it .
b/4801_A_30871	yeah .
sv/4801_B_30872	i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
sd/4801_B_30873	and , of course , you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not . um ,
b/4801_A_30874	yeah .
sd/4801_B_30875	with florida that 's a big problem because there 's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year .
%/4801_B_30876	they ,
b/4801_A_30877	yeah .
sd/4801_A_30878	that 's what 's happening here .
%/4801_A_30879	there is ,
%/4801_A_30880	like , uh , that 's ,
sd/4801_A_30881	in fact , a big gubernatorial issue is the
b/4801_B_30882	uhhuh .
+/4801_A_30883	the turnover rates of , uh , r , uh , repeat offenders being let out and doing it again .
b/4801_B_30884	sure .
sv/4801_B_30885	and it 's like , you know , that 's a big problem
sv/4801_B_30886	but there 's not a whole lot you can do about it because there 's only so many jails you can build
b/4801_A_30887	uhhuh .
sv/4801_B_30888	and it 's really , you know , it 's , it gets to be a r , a big problem .
b/4801_A_30889	yeah .
ad/4801_B_30890	uh , go ahead .
sv/4801_A_30891	i wish if they were going to do it , they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who does n't .
b/4801_B_30892	right .
%/4801_A_30893	be a little more , you know ,
sv/4801_A_30894	not being able to put it off for fifteen years .
b/4801_B_30895	uhhuh .
aa/4801_B_30896	yeah .
sd/4801_B_30897	because a lot of these guys , you know , they get in
sv/4801_B_30898	and they , they get off for good behavior
h/4801_B_30899	and , i do n't know ,
sd/4801_B_30900	up in minnesota where i am now , they do n't have the death penalty .
sd/4801_B_30901	and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system , you know . because they figure well , you know , sure i , i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something .
%/4801_B_30902	uh , but then for ,
sd/4801_B_30903	if i , if i elicit good behavior i 'm out in maybe five or ten .
bh/4801_A_30904	oh , really ?
na/4801_B_30905	oh , sure , you know .
ba/4801_A_30906	goodness .
sd/4801_B_30907	i mean just because , like we said before , they do n't have enough room in the jails
b/4801_A_30908	uhhuh .
+/4801_B_30909	uh , you know , there 's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early .
b/4801_A_30910	yeah .
%/4801_B_30911	but if you 've got the death penalty hanging over your head , uh ,
h/4801_B_30912	i do n't know ,
sv/4801_B_30913	i think that may solve a lot of that .
b/4801_A_30914	yeah .
sv/4801_B_30915	maybe not solve it ,
h/4801_B_30916	but , i do n't know ,
%/4801_B_30917	maybe ,
sv/4801_A_30918	i , yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little , little too lenient .
b/4801_B_30919	yeah .
sv/4801_A_30920	uh , kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty .
b/4801_B_30921	uhhuh .
qw/4801_B_30922	what do you do georgeanne ?
sd/4801_A_30923	i 'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas .
bk/4801_B_30924	oh , okay .
ba/4801_B_30925	great .
qw/4801_B_30926	what program you in ?
sd/4801_A_30927	uh , audiology .
bk/4801_B_30928	okay .
ba/4801_B_30929	fantastic . uh
b/4801_A_30930	yeah .
qw/4801_A_30931	what do you do ?
sd/4801_B_30932	i 'm a doctoral student at the university of central florida .
bh/4801_A_30933	oh , really .
ny/4801_B_30934	yeah ,
sd/4801_B_30935	i 'm doing an internship up at honeywell .
bh/4801_A_30936	oh really ?
ny/4801_B_30937	uh , yeah .
ba/4801_A_30938	neat .
h/4801_B_30939	but , uh , i do n't know .
sv/4801_B_30940	it 's , it 's an interesting issue .
sd/4801_B_30941	there 's , like you say , in texas there 's been quite a few
sd/4801_B_30942	and , and in florida in the last few years , i think there 's been a lot .
sd/4801_B_30943	i ca n't , i , you know , i ca n't give you figures
%/4801_B_30944	but , uh ,
b/4801_A_30945	yeah .
%/4801_A_30946	i just ,
sd/4801_A_30947	this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in california .
b/4801_B_30948	uhhuh .
%/4801_A_30949	so , i think it ,
sd/4801_A_30950	the fortysixth in the last twentyfive years i think is what
bh/4801_B_30951	oh , is that right ?
sd/4801_A_30952	they gave a run down that texas
bk/4801_B_30953	okay .
+/4801_A_30954	texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then .
b/4801_B_30955	yeah ,
%/4801_B_30956	i , i kind of ,
sd/4801_B_30957	yeah , i 've heard things about that .
sd/4801_B_30958	i 've heard that they do n't mess around very much .
b/4801_A_30959	yeah .
sd/4801_A_30960	uh , they , they do n't get repealed as easily as they do .
sd/4801_A_30961	like the guy in california got thir , you know , twice before he went to the gas chamber
sd/4801_A_30962	and then they said okay , no ,
^q/4801_A_30963	you do n't have to go .
sd/4801_A_30964	and then they took him back .
sv/4801_A_30965	i mean , it just seems ,
ba/4801_B_30966	jeez ,
sv/4801_B_30967	that 's a lot of repeals .
+/4801_A_30968	yeah , it just seemed a little inconsistent .
%/4801_A_30969	and then you have like two ,
sd/4801_A_30970	you have these people who are serial killers that did n't even get the death sentence back when
b/4801_B_30971	uhhuh .
+/4801_A_30972	ever you know .
b/4801_B_30973	yeah .
h/4801_B_30974	i do n't know .
^h/4801_B_30975	i , i 'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it .
%/4801_B_30976	uh , i guess ,
qw/4801_B_30977	what is it , what 's the policy now with treason ?
qy/4801_B_30978	do they , uh , do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence ?
nn/4801_A_30979	no ,
sd/4801_A_30980	i do n't , i do n't think , uh , the military does n't execute anymore
%/4801_A_30981	so .
b/4801_B_30982	yeah .
sd/4801_A_30983	or death before the firing squad or whatever .
b/4801_B_30984	yeah .
sv/4801_A_30985	so , i think about the only one is , uh , rape ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/4129_A_62248	okay ,
qo/4129_A_62249	so , what are , what are your views on capital punishment ?
sd/4129_B_62250	i have ambivalent feelings because i do n't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is .
sv/4129_B_62251	but , on the other hand , it is very , very expensive to maintain ,
sd/4129_B_62252	you know , texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country .
aa/4129_A_62253	yes .
sd/4129_B_62254	and it 's eating us alive budget wise
%/4129_B_62255	and , uh ,
qy/4129_A_62256	so are they currently practicing capital punishment
ny/4129_B_62257	yes ,
sd/4129_B_62258	we
+/4129_A_62259	in your state ?
+/4129_B_62260	do practice capital punishment ,
sd/4129_B_62261	but the nature of the , uh , courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it 's a very long haul before anybody 's ever executed .
b/4129_A_62262	yes ,
sd/4129_A_62263	that 's similar to georgia .
b/4129_B_62264	yeah .
sd/4129_B_62265	and then , i was reading in the paper just this morning , it 's interesting because i had forgotten , i guess , that i wrote this little topic down , that it costs more to execute somebody th , than it does to keep them .
sv/4129_A_62266	that 's probably true considering ,
+/4129_B_62267	because of all the costs of the appeals and all that
b/4129_A_62268	yes .
+/4129_B_62269	you know .
b/4129_A_62270	yes ,
sv/4129_A_62271	uh , i guess in a way that , it , it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if ,
sv/4129_B_62272	well , i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people .
aa/4129_A_62273	yes .
+/4129_B_62274	you know , who would see it .
aa/4129_A_62275	right ,
sv/4129_A_62276	that would be the intent of it .
b/4129_B_62277	yeah ,
sv/4129_B_62278	but i 'm not sure how successful that is .
sv/4129_A_62279	well , i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner , if there were n't so many
bf/4129_B_62280	quicker
+/4129_A_62281	appeals .
+/4129_B_62282	maybe ,
b/4129_B_62283	yeah .
aa/4129_A_62284	yeah ,
sv/4129_A_62285	if , if the person who 's going to commit the crime
b/4129_B_62286	uhhuh .
+/4129_A_62287	knew that they were going to be punished severely , possibly capital punishment ,
qw/4129_B_62288	what , what kind of work do you do ?
sd/4129_A_62289	uh , i 'm a research engineer ,
sd/4129_A_62290	i work , uh , f , with georgia tech .
sd/4129_B_62291	um , well , see , i 'm a school principal .
%/4129_A_62292	um .
sd/4129_B_62293	elementary school .
b/4129_A_62294	yes .
sd/4129_B_62295	and in a very poor section of town with p , predominantly anglo kids .
sd/4129_B_62296	and i see kids already that are going to be criminals
%/4129_A_62297	um .
+/4129_B_62298	in spite of everything we can do
sv/4129_B_62299	and , see , i 'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people , that ,
sv/4129_B_62300	i mean , course , you could n't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
b/4129_A_62301	uhhuh .
sv/4129_B_62302	but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids ,
sv/4129_B_62303	we 'd have fewer decisions to make .
aa/4129_A_62304	um , that 's probably true ,
sv/4129_A_62305	but i guess
+/4129_B_62306	down the road , you know .
+/4129_A_62307	there 's other factors that ,
b/4129_B_62308	oh , yeah .
sv/4129_A_62309	but , p , p , pumping more money into the school system is a
sd/4129_B_62310	well
+/4129_A_62311	good thing ,
sv/4129_A_62312	but it 's not going to ,
+/4129_B_62313	i 'm not talking about just in the school system .
b/4129_A_62314	oh , i see .
sd/4129_B_62315	see , i 'm talking about ,
%/4129_B_62316	like , in , in ,
sv/4129_B_62317	uh , i 'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared .
sd/4129_B_62318	uh , i know the institutions do n't work that well ,
sd/4129_B_62319	but it 's a bad day because i get all these kids through my office .
sd/4129_B_62320	i have a school of five hundred and thirtyseven kids .
b/4129_A_62321	uhhuh .
sd/4129_B_62322	five hundred of them are good , solid kids
sd/4129_B_62323	and i have the same thirtyseven in my office every day .
%/4129_A_62324	um .
sd/4129_B_62325	and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible .
sd/4129_B_62326	some of them in the penal system .
ba/4129_A_62327	so that 's a difficult situation .
sd/4129_B_62328	and , you know , you just see those kids going down the road .
sv/4129_B_62329	now , not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment ,
sd/4129_B_62330	but some of them have already been in youth centers .
%/4129_A_62331	um .
+/4129_B_62332	and that kind of thing ,
sv/4129_B_62333	and if we had something to do before they get to be fullblown adult criminals ,
sd/4129_B_62334	and i 'm not talking about necessarily in the school system ,
sv/4129_B_62335	i 'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action .
b/4129_A_62336	uhhuh .
sv/4129_B_62337	i think that 's one reason we have problems in schools , uh ,
sv/4129_B_62338	and some of them are our problems ,
sv/4129_B_62339	but a lot of it 's because everything society wants , we are supposed to do .
b/4129_A_62340	uhhuh .
sv/4129_B_62341	but that 's another subject
%/4129_B_62342	but ,
aa/4129_A_62343	well , that 's probably true .
%/4129_A_62344	w ,
sd/4129_B_62345	anyway , i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has , making a decision what to do with them .
b/4129_A_62346	um , yeah ,
sv/4129_A_62347	i guess that 's not an easy solution .
sv/4129_A_62348	there 's , there 's no easy
b/4129_B_62349	uhhuh .
+/4129_A_62350	solution for that .
aa/4129_B_62351	i do n't , i do n't know that there is an easy solution ,
sv/4129_B_62352	but if you could find a way to prevent some of it , and i 'm not sure what it would be .
b/4129_A_62353	uhhuh .
+/4129_B_62354	it would be money better spent than ,
qy/4129_B_62355	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard ?
x/4129_A_62356	.
sv/4129_B_62357	that 's true .
aa/4129_A_62358	i 'm sure it is ,
aa/4129_A_62359	yeah .
sd/4129_B_62360	statistically , that 's true .
b/4129_A_62361	um , yeah ,
%/4129_A_62362	i do n't , i do n't ,
sv/4129_A_62363	certainly capital punishment is n't
b/4129_B_62364	uhhuh .
+/4129_A_62365	going to solve a lot of problems
%/4129_A_62366	but ,
qy/4129_B_62367	are you for it ?
%/4129_A_62368	uh ,
sd/4129_B_62369	i 'm for it in
sd/4129_A_62370	i guess i am
+/4129_B_62371	in some cases .
+/4129_A_62372	for certain cri ,
b/4129_B_62373	yeah .
aa/4129_A_62374	yeah ,
sd/4129_A_62375	in certain crimes .
qw/4129_B_62376	what kind of crimes would you d , use it for ?
sv/4129_A_62377	uh , premeditated murder .
bk/4129_B_62378	uhhuh .
+/4129_A_62379	crimes of that nature , i think should definitely ,
sd/4129_A_62380	any mass murderer type individual .
sd/4129_B_62381	i , i would consider it for sexual abuse of children , on going .
%/4129_A_62382	um .
+/4129_B_62383	you know , not one instance , but perpetual abusers of children .
b/4129_A_62384	uhhuh .
sd/4129_A_62385	well , you always have castration .
sd/4129_B_62386	well , you know , somebody elected that recently .
b/4129_A_62387	yes ,
sd/4129_A_62388	i read about that .
sd/4129_B_62389	and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it , you know .
b/4129_A_62390	uhhuh .
%/4129_B_62391	but , uh ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/4327_A_66493	right ,
sd/4327_A_66494	uh , actually i lived over in europe for a couple of years ,
sd/4327_A_66495	i lived in germany
sd/4327_A_66496	and in germany they do n't have the jury system .
sd/4327_A_66497	what they do is they have , uh , three judges , basically .
sd/4327_A_66498	and you get up there
sd/4327_A_66499	and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence
sd/4327_A_66500	and your defense attorney presents their evidence
sd/4327_A_66501	and those three guys take the evidence , go off , figure it out and then come back and say whether you 're guilty or not .
sv/4327_B_66502	ou , ou , our judicial system is in such total chaos .
x/4327_A_66503	.
sv/4327_B_66504	i think what they need to do is , they need to somehow take the money out of it .
sd/4327_B_66505	i mean , when you have a man that 's signed a , a , a statement saying he 's guilty ,
sd/4327_B_66506	we have a , a family called all day family .
sd/4327_B_66507	they were all murdered .
b/4327_A_66508	uhhuh .
sd/4327_B_66509	all the people signed confessions ,
sd/4327_B_66510	they went to a trial by jury .
sd/4327_B_66511	they been trying these people now for twentytwo years , ever since i was a child .
ba/4327_A_66512	wow .
sd/4327_B_66513	and what they 've done is they 've bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they 've done ,
sv/4327_B_66514	has nothing to do with justice whatsoever .
h/4327_A_66515	well , you know , it 's , it 's one of those things ,
sd/4327_A_66516	i mean , uh , uh , i would have to look at it .
sv/4327_A_66517	i , if they did it with the , uh , just the judges , the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
sd/4327_A_66518	because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures ,
sd/4327_A_66519	they know what 's good and what is n't ,
sd/4327_A_66520	they 'd be able to say , i 'm sorry ,
^q/4327_A_66521	you ca n't use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained or whatever
sd/4327_A_66522	and , you know , you would n't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the , to the jury
sd/4327_A_66523	and then the judge says , oh , no ,
^q/4327_A_66524	d , disregard that .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/4327_A_66525	come on ,
sv/4327_A_66526	any jury 's not going to disregard the evidence , you know .
aa/4327_B_66527	uh , that 's true .
sv/4327_B_66528	i , i , i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself .
sd/4327_A_66529	that may very well be .
sd/4327_B_66530	i , i hold it in the utmost contempt .
%/4327_A_66531	uh ,
sd/4327_B_66532	the , uh , d , my favorite is the police department ,
sv/4327_B_66533	they 're not aimed at the criminal .
sv/4327_B_66534	the judicial system is aimed at the citizens
sd/4327_B_66535	because you and i , we have work schedules ,
sd/4327_B_66536	we can be called at work ,
sd/4327_B_66537	we have social security numbers ,
sd/4327_B_66538	they can trace us down ,
sd/4327_B_66539	we have telephones ,
sd/4327_B_66540	then we have checkbooks .
sv/4327_B_66541	criminals have none of these things .
sv/4327_B_66542	they 're real difficult to catch ,
sv/4327_B_66543	and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas us , we write a check .
b/4327_A_66544	yeah .
qh/4327_B_66545	so where do you think they target their efforts ?
aa/4327_A_66546	that 's true .
%/4327_A_66547	you d ,
sv/4327_B_66548	they target their efforts toward the citizens
qo/4327_A_66549	well ,
+/4327_B_66550	not the criminals .
+/4327_A_66551	how would you go about changing it ?
%/4327_B_66552	you know , that 's a ,
sv/4327_B_66553	i 've nailed the problem down
%/4327_B_66554	but i ,
x/4327_A_66555	.
x/4327_B_66556	.
^2/4327_A_66557	leave the details up to somebody else , huh .
aa/4327_B_66558	yeah ,
sd/4327_B_66559	i 'm going to have to leave those details like , what would you do about ,
sv/4327_B_66560	i think , to begin with , you would h , you would have ,
sv/4327_B_66561	like , here in atlanta area , our crime rate is just astronomical ,
sd/4327_B_66562	yet , you go out on the streets
sd/4327_B_66563	and they 're giving speeding tickets .
b/4327_A_66564	yeah .
sv/4327_B_66565	i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from ,
sv/4327_A_66566	well , you know , uh , talking about the lawyers , you know what might very well do , uh , cause a , uh , a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases .
sv/4327_A_66567	it 's kind of like do it , do it in the similar vein similar , like , uh , v c r or television repair .
sd/4327_A_66568	if you take your t v in , a lot of these t v repair places will say , well , i 'll repair your t v for a hundred dollars ,
sd/4327_A_66569	and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that 's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it .
sd/4327_A_66570	he , he repairs it , gives it back to you , and takes your hundred dollars .
sd/4327_A_66571	now , if he comes in and says , you know , i 'll repair your , your v c r , or somebody else 's v c r , for a hundred dollars , gets in there ,
sd/4327_A_66572	maybe it 's a blown fuse ,
sd/4327_A_66573	takes him two minutes ,
sd/4327_A_66574	he fixes it ,
sd/4327_A_66575	he still charges you that hundred dollars .
sv/4327_A_66576	so , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it 's a murder case or a , you know , a civil , uh , somebody suing somebody else , you get x dollars for that case
sd/4327_A_66577	and that 's it .
aa/4327_B_66578	now ,
%/4327_A_66579	none of this ,
+/4327_B_66580	i firmly believe in that
qy/4327_B_66581	because when you get the most heinous of crimes , have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney ?
ny/4327_A_66582	oh , yeah .
sd/4327_B_66583	and here 's this bum that did n't have a job
b/4327_A_66584	yeah .
sd/4327_B_66585	and he 's got a attorney that you and i could never afford .
aa/4327_A_66586	that 's true .
qh/4327_B_66587	who 's
b/4327_A_66588	yeah .
+/4327_B_66589	paying for that ?
sv/4327_A_66590	um , y , well , you , you know , you 're talking to part of them that 's paying for that .
b/4327_B_66591	yeah ,
sv/4327_B_66592	and you 're talking to the other half that 's paying for it
x/4327_B_66593	.
aa/4327_A_66594	that 's right .
sv/4327_A_66595	you know that 's , it , it 's , it 's amazing
sv/4327_A_66596	and , and when you stop and look at it , i mean , the judges , th , they 're all former lawyers .
b/4327_B_66597	yeah ,
sv/4327_B_66598	well , that 's another problem .
sv/4327_B_66599	i think to really correct the judicial system , you have to get the lawyers out of it .
x/4327_A_66600	.
sv/4327_B_66601	i mean , they 're , they 're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever ,
sv/4327_B_66602	and with that type person running it , i mean , you , you could expect that you ,
qo/2372_A_75851	well , how about you .
qy/2372_A_75852	do you use p c s ?
na/2372_B_75853	oh constantly .
b/2372_A_75854	yeah .
sd/2372_A_75855	you and me both .
sd/2372_B_75856	it seems everything i do is computer related .
b/2372_A_75857	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_75858	and if it goes down , then we 're stuck all day .
b/2372_A_75859	yeah .
sd/2372_A_75860	and so i like the i b m p c , personally .
b/2372_B_75861	huhuh .
sd/2372_A_75862	but that 's pretty much everything i 've worked with
sd/2372_A_75863	and , uh , i 've become so accustomed to it that , uh , it 's second nature .
b/2372_B_75864	yeah .
qo/2372_A_75865	what do you use ?
sd/2372_B_75866	well , i have an , i , i b m p s two , model thirty .
b/2372_A_75867	yeah .
sd/2372_B_75868	it 's kind of , kind of getting too slow for me ,
sd/2372_B_75869	but my job , i 'm an e d p auditor ,
sd/2372_B_75870	so i audit , uh , computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level .
b/2372_A_75871	oh , huhuh .
sd/2372_B_75872	and i use my personal computer constantly ,
sd/2372_B_75873	not only do i do p c type things like , uh , using lotus or word processors ,
b/2372_A_75874	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_75875	i also use my p c to emulate a mainframe terminal for our i b m mainframe
b/2372_A_75876	huhuh .
+/2372_B_75877	and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine .
b/2372_A_75878	oh , okay .
sd/2372_B_75879	so all i have on my desk is my p c ,
sd/2372_B_75880	but i 'm , i 'm getting , not only our local area network ,
sd/2372_B_75881	but i 'm getting two separate mainframe machines , also .
b/2372_A_75882	oh , okay .
sd/2372_A_75883	so we , um , we use , it 's an i b m p s two also .
b/2372_B_75884	huhuh .
sd/2372_A_75885	and , um , you know , every now and then the file gets so big , that , you know , it moves slower than i 'd like
b/2372_B_75886	huhuh .
sd/2372_A_75887	but i , uh , i do mainly graphic work on it .
b/2372_B_75888	huhuh .
+/2372_A_75889	and , uh , a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it .
b/2372_B_75890	yeah .
h/2372_A_75891	and , uh , i do n't know ,
sd/2372_A_75892	i just , i enjoy working with them .
b/2372_B_75893	yeah .
sv/2372_A_75894	there 's so many capabilities out there ,
sv/2372_A_75895	i mean , the things you can do are endless .
aa/2372_B_75896	yeah .
sd/2372_B_75897	i 've become kind of the p c guru in our audit department because it 's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground ,
b/2372_A_75898	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_75899	and there 's three of us e d p auditors
sd/2372_B_75900	and one of the three of us has an accounting background
sd/2372_B_75901	and so she 's not real proficient in p c 's
sd/2372_B_75902	and the other just has ,
b/2372_A_75903	yeah .
+/2372_B_75904	not used p c 's that much ,
sd/2372_B_75905	so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they 're doing
sd/2372_B_75906	and i 'm the administrator for our local area network .
sd/2372_B_75907	and i need to keep that going
sd/2372_B_75908	and ,
b/2372_A_75909	huhuh .
+/2372_B_75910	so , i , i 'm , i could n't live my life without a p c .
sd/2372_B_75911	i do n't have one at home ,
sd/2372_A_75912	we have one at home ,
sd/2372_A_75913	but i just do n't find the time that i can use it .
b/2372_B_75914	yeah .
sd/2372_B_75915	right now i would rather not have one at home , because i would work at home .
b/2372_A_75916	yes .
sd/2372_B_75917	um , we 've got a couple of portable lap top p c 's at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot ,
b/2372_A_75918	huhuh .
+/2372_B_75919	to do work .
sd/2372_B_75920	if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night .
sd/2372_A_75921	one of the reasons why i got mine , was before i went on maternity leave ,
sd/2372_A_75922	they did n't know how they were going to do without me at work because , i am pretty much the , like you said , the guru ,
b/2372_B_75923	yeah .
+/2372_A_75924	in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is ,
b/2372_B_75925	huhuh .
sd/2372_A_75926	and , um , so they did n't know how it was going to work ,
sd/2372_A_75927	they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could , in the decks machine so that we could , in my home , so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so .
b/2372_B_75928	yeah .
sv/2372_A_75929	but , uh , you know , it 's , uh , it 's almost like we could become too dependent on them .
b/2372_B_75930	yeah .
sd/2372_A_75931	and oh , i , we use a lot of free lance .
b/2372_B_75932	huhuh .
sd/2372_A_75933	and , uh , that 's , uh , pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things .
b/2372_B_75934	yeah .
%/2372_A_75935	and , um , it ,
sv/2372_A_75936	uh , compared to the way the things have upgraded ,
b/2372_B_75937	right .
+/2372_A_75938	have , uh , really ,
t1/2372_A_75939	what 's the word i 'm looking for ,
sd/2372_A_75940	i 'm just totally drawing a blank .
x/2372_B_75941	.
sv/2372_A_75942	but , uh , the way things have changed over the years with the p c and the different programs is just great .
sv/2372_A_75943	it 's remarkable the things we can do now , and compared to , you know , a few years .
b/2372_B_75944	yeah .
+/2372_A_75945	just the power ,
sd/2372_A_75946	i 'm , i 'm trying to , uh , get an updated machine .
sd/2372_A_75947	mine , uh , is just putting along .
sv/2372_B_75948	and it 's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip ,
sd/2372_B_75949	but , uh ,
b/2372_A_75950	yeah .
+/2372_B_75951	i do n't know if my boss will spring for it .
x/2372_A_75952	.
sd/2372_B_75953	but i 'm determined to brake mine
sd/2372_B_75954	so he has to get me another one .
x/2372_A_75955	.
sd/2372_B_75956	we think about that a lot .
b/2372_A_75957	yeah .
sd/2372_B_75958	well , that 's what i do .
sd/2372_B_75959	we had a printer , a hewlett packard ready writer .
b/2372_A_75960	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_75961	and we had about ten people sharing this printer
sd/2372_B_75962	by , it was attached to like a central p c
sd/2372_B_75963	and you had to take your diskette to the p c to print something .
ba/2372_A_75964	um , now that 's awful .
sd/2372_B_75965	so the first thing when i started working at this bank , is , i said , well , now first of all we need to all be able to share this p c without getting up .
sd/2372_B_75966	so i talked my boss into investing in a , it 's not a , uh , a uh , real elaborate local area network ,
b/2372_A_75967	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_75968	but we can share the printer
sd/2372_B_75969	and we can , uh , send files to each other ,
b/2372_A_75970	okay .
sd/2372_B_75971	and we can mail , send mail messages to each other ,
b/2372_A_75972	oh , okay .
+/2372_B_75973	which is good enough ,
sd/2372_B_75974	it 's what we need .
b/2372_A_75975	right .
sd/2372_B_75976	and then i talked them into buying a h p laser jet .
b/2372_A_75977	oh , yes .
sd/2372_B_75978	and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it .
sd/2372_B_75979	but once he bought it , he has been so pleased .
sd/2372_B_75980	it 's , it 's fast ,
%/2372_B_75981	it 's quite ,
sd/2372_B_75982	oh , it has good copy .
aa/2372_A_75983	right .
sv/2372_A_75984	the copy that you can with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers .
aa/2372_B_75985	yeah .
sd/2372_B_75986	i 've got a little , little , uh , i b m pro printer on my desk ,
b/2372_A_75987	yeah .
sd/2372_B_75988	but , and i can use either the pro printer
sd/2372_B_75989	or i 've got my p c configured to where i can use either printer . the one that 's on the network or my own .
b/2372_A_75990	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_75991	so if i just need something real quick , and i do n't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed ,
sd/2372_B_75992	i can just print it in my office .
sd/2372_A_75993	um , we 're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer .
b/2372_B_75994	yeah .
sd/2372_A_75995	and , uh , it 's just so ,
sd/2372_A_75996	the budget restraints and things like that , it 's , makes it difficult
%/2372_A_75997	and , uh ,
sv/2372_B_75998	they have gotten really cheap .
sd/2372_B_75999	hewlett packard makes , it 's actually a dot matrix printer
b/2372_A_76000	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_76001	but the quality is almost laser quality .
b/2372_A_76002	oh , huhuh .
sd/2372_B_76003	and i think it 's called the desk jet
sd/2372_B_76004	and they 're , you understand , i think they 're about five hundred dollars now .
sd/2372_A_76005	and we , uh , got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars .
bh/2372_B_76006	oh , really .
ny/2372_A_76007	yeah ,
sd/2372_A_76008	i do n't remember what kind they were ,
sd/2372_A_76009	but , uh , we do a lot of transparencies .
b/2372_B_76010	huhuh .
sd/2372_A_76011	sometimes the color would take too long to plot out .
b/2372_B_76012	yeah .
sd/2372_A_76013	so they just want black and white , which see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick .
b/2372_B_76014	yeah .
+/2372_A_76015	because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it .
b/2372_B_76016	yeah .
%/2372_A_76017	but , uh , it , uh ,
qy^d/2372_B_76018	so that 's all you need for like charts and stuff .
qy^d/2372_B_76019	you do n't need them in four colors .
nn/2372_A_76020	no ,
nn/2372_A_76021	huhuh .
sd/2372_A_76022	if it was a customer presentation then that would be different .
b/2372_B_76023	yeah .
sd/2372_A_76024	we would want to razzledazzle a bit .
%/2372_A_76025	but , uh , it 's , uh ,
%/2372_A_76026	yeah .
sd/2372_A_76027	we have one in the office
sd/2372_A_76028	and if we want , well in our area , if we want to use it , we have to , you know , like you said , you had to change it , put it on a disc ,
x/2372_B_76029	.
+/2372_A_76030	and carry it over to there , and see if they 're not using the printer ,
qy^d/2372_B_76031	you use the sneak , system .
na/2372_A_76032	right .
b/2372_B_76033	yeah .
sd/2372_A_76034	and , uh , wait for an opportunity to use it .
b/2372_B_76035	yeah ,
sd/2372_B_76036	we you 'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer .
b/2372_A_76037	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_76038	until they got off the machine .
aa/2372_A_76039	i know ,
aa/2372_A_76040	i know ,
aa/2372_A_76041	i understand .
%/2372_B_76042	that was ,
sd/2372_B_76043	i was amazed when i came to work ,
sd/2372_B_76044	i worked at the , uh ,
sd/2372_B_76045	well , it used to be the largest bank in san antonio until n c n b came up and bought the rival
sd/2372_B_76046	and now n c n b .
b/2372_A_76047	huhuh .
+/2372_B_76048	and now n c n b 's got a little larger market share ,
%/2372_B_76049	but it 's the only , uh ,
sd/2372_B_76050	well , it 's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in texas .
sd/2372_B_76051	it 's the only one that 's still alive .
b/2372_A_76052	oh , huhuh .
sd/2372_B_76053	any way , i work in a big prestigious place .
b/2372_A_76054	right .
sd/2372_B_76055	and i could n't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here 's the audit department of this , this huge holding company , sharing a h p rugged writer .
x/2372_A_76056	.
sd/2372_B_76057	i was going oh , wait a minute .
x/2372_A_76058	.
^q/2372_B_76059	come on guys ,
^q/2372_B_76060	this is crummy .
qh/2372_A_76061	so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you 're behind the times in technology .
aa/2372_B_76062	yeah ,
aa/2372_B_76063	yeah .
sd/2372_B_76064	we 're pushing real hard though .
%/2372_B_76065	we 're , we 're trying ,
sd/2372_B_76066	well , see , the entire bank is not like that .
%/2372_B_76067	we ,
sd/2372_B_76068	the , the bank philosophy is one of innovation and ,
b/2372_A_76069	huhuh .
+/2372_B_76070	lead the market .
sd/2372_B_76071	it 's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the , uh , the senior vice president , over audits , is cheap .
b/2372_A_76072	huhuh .
sd/2372_B_76073	and it 's real hard to pry money out of him to , to do these things ,
sd/2372_B_76074	but i was , i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
%/2372_B_76075	and ,
b/2372_A_76076	right .
b/2372_B_76077	um .
sd/2372_A_76078	we find it hard to believe sometimes , or hard to understand when , uh , we work for a computer company , and , uh , how are we supposed to present the imagine that we 're supposed to present with equipment that 's outdated ,
b/2372_B_76079	yeah .
+/2372_A_76080	that 's obsolete
sd/2372_A_76081	and the guys that , some of the guys that run this place are very tight
sd/2372_A_76082	and it 's like , well , why do we need this ,
^q/2372_A_76083	ca n't you do that with , you know , what we have ,
sd/2372_A_76084	and when we try and then they complain about , this does n't look good .
b/2372_B_76085	yeah .
sv/2372_B_76086	unfortunately , the , the , uh , computer equipment and , and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly ,
sd/2372_B_76087	like for instance , we bought a ...

sd/4643_A_94253	you made it .
ba/4643_B_94254	that 's great !
%/4643_A_94255	and then i , it 's like well the thrill is gone
sd/4643_A_94256	so let 's do something else .
aa/4643_B_94257	right .
bf/4643_B_94258	you want to , uh , e , explore a new field
%/4643_B_94259	or , or ,
aa/4643_A_94260	well , yeah ,
sd/4643_A_94261	i , i 'm signed up for a class in pottery making because i 've never tried that yet

sd/4643_A_94271	and that way i have time for my kids too .
sv/4643_A_94272	and i 've been fortunate that i can afford to work parttime .
sd/4643_A_94273	i do n't know how long that 's going to last .
b/4643_B_94274	oh , yeah .
sd/4643_A_94275	and , uh , they 're cutting back ,
sd/4643_A_94276	so i do n't go in all that often
sd/4643_A_94277	but
+/4643_A_94278	i 've been real interested in some of those cute country , country kind of things .
sd/4643_A_94279	uh , i see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars
sd/4643_A_94280	and i say , oh no
sd/4643_A_94281	and , and i go
sd/4643_A_94282	and i make it .
b/4643_B_94283	yeah .

sd/4643_A_94287	and i saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and , and , and knife and , and a fork and all kinds of stuff
sd/4643_A_94288	and i went
sd/4643_A_94289	and i signed up for class because then again , you get , you know , get someone to guide you
sd/4643_A_94290	and you get the tools you do n't
+/4643_A_94291	feel like buying .
aa/4643_B_94292	exactly .
sd/4643_A_94293	and i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars .
sd/4643_A_94294	it took me a lot of time
sd/4643_A_94295	but
b/4643_B_94296	oh , yeah .
+/4643_A_94297	it did n't ,
sd/4643_A_94298	but if it cost me twenty dollars , you know ,
%/4643_A_94299	and then i ,
^2/4643_B_94300	and your time ,
sv/4643_B_94301	then you 're that much farther ahead .
b/4643_A_94302	yeah .
sd/4643_A_94303	then i saw a , one of these country looking wood watermelons .
sd/4643_A_94304	it was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it .
b/4643_B_94305	right .
sd/4643_B_94306	i 've seen them
sd/4643_B_94307	and then the watermelon , the red with the , with the seeds painted in
sd/4643_B_94308	and ,
b/4643_A_94309	oh , yeah .
b/4643_A_94310	uhhuh .
sv/4643_B_94311	that 's neat .
sd/4643_A_94312	i went there ,
sd/4643_A_94313	we have home depot out here .
qy^d/4643_A_94314	i do n't know if you 've heard of it .
sd/4643_A_94315	i went
sd/4643_A_94316	and i got
ny/4643_B_94317	yes .
sd/4643_B_94318	we have one .
+/4643_A_94319	two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon .
sd/4643_A_94320	i had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
sd/4643_A_94321	and
b/4643_B_94322	huh .
+/4643_A_94323	cutting that wedge out was no joke .
ba/4643_B_94324	oh , i 'm , i 'm sure .
sd/4643_A_94325	we did it on a , i had a , uh , i did it
qy^d/4643_B_94326	a band saw ?
+/4643_A_94327	through adult ed again .
br/4643_B_94328	what ?
sd/4643_A_94329	i did it through adult ed again .
b/4643_B_94330	uhhuh .
sd/4643_A_94331	and the teacher was one of these negative people ,
^q/4643_A_94332	oh that 's dangerous ,
^q/4643_A_94333	we ca n't do that ,
^q/4643_A_94334	we just ca n't do that .
sd/4643_A_94335	and i 'm going well how about this way ?
^q/4643_A_94336	i , i want to do that ,
^q/4643_A_94337	that was the plan here .
b/4643_B_94338	right .
sd/4643_A_94339	so we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of
^2/4643_B_94340	a cradle for it .
+/4643_A_94341	a cradle for it .
b/4643_B_94342	yeah ,
bf/4643_B_94343	so you can steady it
qy/4643_B_94344	and then , you used a handsaw or a backsaw ?
sd/4643_A_94345	well , it , the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw
sd/4643_A_94346	but there 's no coping saw big enough to , for a fourteen inch wide watermelon that
b/4643_B_94347	right ,
b/4643_B_94348	right .
sd/4643_A_94349	and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw .
sd/4643_A_94350	i said i 'm not that steady ,
^q/4643_A_94351	it 's not going to happen .
b/4643_B_94352	yeah .
sd/4643_A_94353	so we built a cradle for it
sd/4643_A_94354	and we got th , once it was turned , we got one s , one cut out on the table saw , on the radial saw ,
x/4643_B_94355	.
sd/4643_A_94356	by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about .
b/4643_B_94357	right .
%/4643_A_94358	so ,
qy/4643_B_94359	now did you cut a quarter wedge in this ?
ng/4643_A_94360	uh , i 'd say it 's about an eighth .
%/4643_A_94361	you know jus ,
sd/4643_B_94362	well , i , i 'm envisioning , uh , uh , a water , a watermelon like a log
%/4643_B_94363	and then , uh , what i 've seen of this kind before is you have the , uh , the , uh ,
sd/4643_B_94364	it 's , uh ,
sd/4643_B_94365	if you 're looking at adding on you have ,
sd/3035_A_95855	uh , our children are both , uh , basically adults .
sd/3035_A_95856	they , we 've , we 've got two .
sd/3035_A_95857	uh , one is twentyone ,
sd/3035_A_95858	and one is twentyfive .
b/3035_B_95859	uhhuh .
sd/3035_A_95860	and they , they still live at home .
b/3035_B_95861	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_95862	well , that 's , that 's a little unusual for , uh , for children of that age , to have both of them that age at home .
sv/3035_A_95863	but , uh , i guess the activities that , uh , we have with them are , uh , pretty few and far between .
sd/3035_A_95864	actually the , they 're both going on their own most of the time .
b/3035_B_95865	uhhuh .
sd/3035_A_95866	so , uh , most of our activities are , you know , just discussion type things about what 's going on in the family and what they 're doing and
b/3035_B_95867	uhhuh .
+/3035_A_95868	that kind of thing .
sd/3035_B_95869	well , we have a , uh , three year old and a one year old .
sd/3035_B_95870	and , uh , so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know .
aa/3035_A_95871	sure it does .
sd/3035_B_95872	and , uh , most of the time with a three year old we 're trying to , to get him , uh ,
sd/3035_B_95873	well , we play usually in the evening when , when i get home , you know , about five o'clock or so until about eight , you know , with the exception of dinner .
sd/3035_B_95874	out in the front or backyard playing like , uh , tee ball off the , you know , off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball .
sd/3035_B_95875	uh , since we just got here we got the , uh , uh , new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him ,
sd/3035_B_95876	and he really likes riding that around .
b/3035_A_95877	uhhuh .
b/3035_A_95878	oh , yeah .
%/3035_A_95879	i ,
%/3035_B_95880	so , you know ,
sd/3035_B_95881	and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and , uh , playing squirt guns and all that ,
sd/3035_B_95882	he really likes that .
b/3035_A_95883	yeah .
sd/3035_B_95884	and , uh , the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything ,
sd/3035_B_95885	trying to do everything he does .
b/3035_A_95886	yeah ,
qy/3035_A_95887	is the one year old a boy ?
nn/3035_B_95888	no ,
sd/3035_B_95889	it 's a girl .
b^m/3035_A_95890	a girl ?
ny/3035_B_95891	yeah .
%/3035_A_95892	yea ,
sd/3035_A_95893	ours , uh , the older one is a girl ,
%/3035_A_95894	so .
sd/3035_A_95895	and the , and the younger one is a boy ,
%/3035_A_95896	so .
b/3035_B_95897	yeah .
sv/3035_A_95898	uh , i guess , uh , what i see is so far as , uh , the trends , uh , uh , for children , uh ,
sd/3035_A_95899	i do n't know what kind of a area virginia beach is ,
sd/3035_A_95900	but , of course , uh , richardson is in the dallas area .
b/3035_B_95901	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_95902	and i think , uh , the big city , uh ,
sd/3035_A_95903	activities for , for children now are ,
sv/3035_A_95904	they 're good
sv/3035_A_95905	but there 's so much , uh , potential danger , you know ,
sv/3035_A_95906	that you really have to watch your children so closely now
sv/3035_A_95907	that ,
b/3035_B_95908	uhhuh .
+/3035_A_95909	you ca n't let them grow up the way , the way i grew up , you know .
sd/3035_A_95910	i , i 'm from a smaller town in east texas .
sd/3035_A_95911	and i could , you know , go and do whatever , pretty much whatever i wanted to do ,
b/3035_B_95912	uhhuh .
+/3035_A_95913	uh , my whole life .
sd/3035_A_95914	uh , you know , i never , never had to worry about the bad guys being out there .
b/3035_B_95915	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_95916	and , uh , you know , i find it 's , it 's quite a bit different now
sv/3035_A_95917	that , uh , you know , you have to watch your children so closely and , uh , keep up with them .
sv/3035_A_95918	i , i feel like , uh ,
sv/3035_A_95919	that it 's , it 's really a sad commentary on , uh , you know , a life in general ,
b/3035_B_95920	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_95921	that , uh , you know that children ca n't , can not be allowed to grow up , uh , you know , without really close supervision .
aa/3035_B_95922	well , i , i agree with that ,
sv/3035_B_95923	and i seem , i seem to feel the same way , you know ,
sd/3035_B_95924	even just when i grew up and everything .
sv/3035_B_95925	and , and , the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is , is at hand and everything .
b/3035_A_95926	uhhuh .
sv/3035_B_95927	uh , the only other thing i have noticed though is that , uh , it seems that there 's been a lot of or more empha , emphasis at least in what we 've been dealing with
%/3035_B_95928	and , and the looking , you know ,
sd/3035_B_95929	just start not even ,
sd/3035_B_95930	not really looking for a school for him but , uh , like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something .
b/3035_A_95931	uhhuh .
sd/3035_B_95932	for , for a three year old it 's that , uh ,
sv/3035_B_95933	there 's a lot of emphasis on , on , on , on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten .
b/3035_A_95934	right .
sv/3035_B_95935	and , and it seems like it 's a lot more than the , they need to know and be able to do than when we are the , when i had to go in t , ki , kindergarten .
b/3035_A_95936	yeah .
sv/3035_B_95937	and it seems like it 's more , uh ,
h/3035_B_95938	you know , i do n't know .
sv/3035_B_95939	they 're expecting more or , uh , or just , uh , you know ,
sv/3035_B_95940	kids just because of the computer age or whatever , it just , know more when they get , you know , to be five or six or something .
b/3035_A_95941	yeah .
%/3035_B_95942	but ,
sd/3035_A_95943	um , i guess looking at , uh , back at , at what our children did compared to what , uh , you know , what i had to go through in school .
sv/3035_A_95944	the , uh , there i , there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum .
sv/3035_A_95945	it 's a lot more complicated .
sv/3035_A_95946	a lot more available , of course .
b/3035_B_95947	uhhuh .
%/3035_A_95948	but , uh , this ,
sv/3035_A_95949	so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult , i would think .
sv/3035_A_95950	i , i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself .
b/3035_B_95951	uhhuh .
%/3035_A_95952	uh , you know , just ,
sv/3035_A_95953	or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when i went to school .
b/3035_B_95954	uhhuh .
sd/3035_B_95955	one thing is i got a home computer too
sd/3035_B_95956	and , uh , i play , uh , with the three year old
sd/3035_B_95957	i play some computer games and stuff with him .
b/3035_A_95958	uhhuh .
sd/3035_B_95959	educational games like , you know , concentration type games ,
b/3035_A_95960	right .
+/3035_B_95961	the matching , things like that .
b/3035_A_95962	yeah .
sd/3035_B_95963	and , uh , he 's , he really likes it
sv/3035_B_95964	and , uh , and i think it 's important because i think that , uh , you know , it gives him the interaction with the computer
sv/3035_B_95965	because it sure looks like that 's going to be you , you know , the big thing for a long time .
b/3035_A_95966	huh ,
sd/3035_B_95967	and given ,
b/3035_A_95968	yeah ,
%/3035_A_95969	i think , uh ,
+/3035_B_95970	given that knowledge and stuff with it
sv/3035_B_95971	and he seems to enjoy it .
b/3035_A_95972	faint oh .
sd/3035_B_95973	and , uh , of course , the one year old has n't , has n't gotten there yet
%/3035_B_95974	but , uh ,
sd/3035_B_95975	and the other thing we try to do is , uh , since the summer 's time 's here is , uh , sign him up for , and her , for , uh , different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming ,
b/3035_A_95976	right .
b/3035_A_95977	yeah .
%/3035_B_95978	you know , uh ,
%/3035_B_95979	or ,
sd/3035_B_95980	there 's a little soccer thing that he 's going to do for a week or so
%/3035_B_95981	and , uh , you know ,
sd/3035_B_95982	where they go for an hour or so .
b/3035_A_95983	yeah .
%/3035_B_95984	and , uh ,
sd/3035_B_95985	because , uh , when he was a baby that we did the swimming too
sd/3035_B_95986	and he really liked it
sd/3035_B_95987	so we 're going to do that with our daughter too .
b/3035_A_95988	yeah .
sv/3035_A_95989	that , uh , uh , watching a little , little boys play soccer is , is more fun .
x/3035_B_95990	.
sv/3035_A_95991	i ca n't imagine th , them having as much fun as the parents ,
x/3035_B_95992	.
+/3035_A_95993	had watching them .
aa/3035_B_95994	i know .
sd/3035_B_95995	well , we were just talking about that too .
sv/3035_B_95996	and i guess it 's not really soccer it 's just kind of a , well , kick the ball around for a while ,
b/3035_A_95997	right ,
b/3035_A_95998	yeah .
+/3035_B_95999	see what happens .
bf/3035_A_96000	the , the disorganized play really what it was ,
%/3035_A_96001	but ,
aa/3035_B_96002	yeah .
+/3035_A_96003	but , uh ,
b/3035_A_96004	yeah ,
sd/3035_A_96005	when ours was a ,
%/3035_A_96006	he ,
sd/3035_A_96007	i guess he was probably five or six , you know , when he first started playing soccer .
b/3035_B_96008	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_96009	and , uh , and that was , that was more fun to watch those boys trying to , trying to kick the ball up and down the field .
b/3035_B_96010	uhhuh .
%/3035_A_96011	but , uh ,
%/3035_A_96012	and it 's ,
sv/3035_A_96013	i guess , that was , you know , as important , uh , as much important to the parents as it was to the children that , uh , you know , to get out and watch the kids play ,
%/3035_A_96014	so .
b/3035_B_96015	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_96016	i guess one of the things that i think about is a , talking about education , uh , i kind of feel like , uh , that , uh , the , the school systems in this , particularly in this area , the systems are not under enough control .
sv/3035_A_96017	the , the students have a little too much , uh , too much leeway .
b/3035_B_96018	uhhuh .
fa/3035_A_96019	excuse me .
sv/3035_A_96020	um , an , an , and the , and that 's kind of contradictory to what i said
%/3035_A_96021	but , you know , you ,
%/3035_A_96022	the , hell
sv/3035_A_96023	you have to be under control so much when they 're out
sv/3035_A_96024	but when they 're in school they , they do n't have quite , quite as much control ,
b/3035_B_96025	right ,
b/3035_B_96026	right .
+/3035_A_96027	over them as , uh ,
b/3035_B_96028	right .
+/3035_A_96029	as what i would liked to have seen .
b/3035_B_96030	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_96031	uh , uh , i kind of feel like there 's , there 's too much allowed to go on in at , at school .
b/3035_B_96032	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_96033	and , uh , you know , it tends to , uh , to encourage students to not be as , you know , to not concentrate as much on the education .
b/3035_B_96034	uhhuh .
sv/3035_A_96035	you know , they 're , they 're there for a good time .
b/3035_B_96036	right .
sv/3035_A_96037	and , you know , to , to see how little they can get by with .
b/3035_B_96038	uhhuh .
sd/3035_B_96039	well , i know of number of people that are in the , in the , uh , school district an , down in , in , uh , san antonio .
sv/3035_B_96040	and , uh , it seems like it 's ,
sv/3035_B_96041	a lot of the problem is to , you know ,
sd/3035_B_96042	you always have the lack of funds
sv/3035_B_96043	but it seems to be getting worse and worse
sv/3035_B_96044	and so they do n't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as , as , as ,
b/3035_A_96045	right .
+/3035_B_96046	kids need .
sv/3035_B_96047	and , uh , you know ,
%/3035_A_96048	but , uh ,
+/3035_B_96049	that 's just a problem that who knows how that 's going to , that 's going to come out or anything .
%/3035_B_96050	but ,
b/3035_A_96051	faint yeah .
h/3035_A_96052	but , uh , i , i do n't , i do n't know
sv/3035_A_96053	i think , uh , you know , some of the thing has to do with , uh ,
x/3035_B_96054	.
+/3035_A_96055	with the civil rights program .
sv/3035_A_96056	not that the civil rights program is bad
%/3035_A_96057	but that there 's ,
sv/3035_A_96058	it carried over ,
b/3035_B_96059	uhhuh .
+/3035_A_96060	into , you know , individual rights
%/3035_A_96061	and it , you know , trickled ou ,
fp/3030_A_98587	well , hi .
sd/3030_A_98588	i guess , uh , i 'll just start by saying that we entertain with , uh , a gourmet club here . um , which means that we have like eight , eight people , four couples .
b/3030_B_98589	uhhuh .
sd/3030_A_98590	and most of the husbands ,
sv/3030_A_98591	this is really peculiar ,
sd/3030_A_98592	most of the husbands cook .
ba/3030_B_98593	great .
sv/3030_A_98594	i mean , the wives during the day , you know , get , i guess , so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day .
x/3030_B_98595	.
sd/3030_A_98596	um , you know they do n't really care about gourmet stuff ,
sd/3030_A_98597	but it was the guys that got together and did all this .
ba/3030_B_98598	oh , that 's nice .
sd/3030_A_98599	and , um , like my husband just , he really , really likes to cook in terms of , um , oh , barbecue ,
sv/3030_A_98600	and i mean all guys , i think , like to barbecue .
sv/3030_A_98601	i think it 's caveman ,
b/3030_B_98602	right ,
b/3030_B_98603	right .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/3030_A_98604	i 'm telling you ,
sd/3030_A_98605	but , um , he really does cook
sv/3030_A_98606	and it 's a good thing because , you know , you ca n't , you ca n't knock that .
aa/3030_B_98607	no .
sd/3030_A_98608	but all these other guys do too ,
sd/3030_A_98609	and so we 've gotten together
sd/3030_A_98610	and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals .
x/3030_B_98611	.
sv/3030_A_98612	and it 's really , really kind of a neat thing to do .
%/3030_A_98613	you ,
qw/3030_B_98614	how often do you meet ?
%/3030_A_98615	well , we try ,
^h/3030_A_98616	i mean , because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that .
sd/3030_A_98617	it 's like , you know , if we can do it once every six months , we 're doing well .
b/3030_B_98618	oh , yes ,
b/3030_B_98619	yes .
b/3030_A_98620	yeah .
sd/3030_A_98621	so , i mean we originally started out , you know , when we were younger
b/3030_B_98622	uhhuh .
+/3030_A_98623	and did n't have so much stuff going on with the kids . um ,
sd/3030_A_98624	then we would , we tried to do it every other month ,
b/3030_B_98625	yeah .
sd/3030_A_98626	but lately it 's just been once every six months .
b/3030_B_98627	oh .
sv/3030_B_98628	well , that 's much more reasonable .
sd/3030_B_98629	i was involved in a , a club like that for , um , that , you know , where we tried to really do gourmet , uh , meals .
b/3030_A_98630	yeah .
sv/3030_B_98631	and , uh , we , we were a little bit too frequent i think .
b/3030_A_98632	oh .
sd/3030_B_98633	i do n't remember if we were once a month
sv/3030_B_98634	or anyway it was , it was difficult .
sd/3030_B_98635	by the time we went around it was , uh , four couples
sd/3030_B_98636	so , uh , by the time we got around , uh , to each of us and it was time again , we were almost tired , you know .
b/3030_A_98637	really ,
b/3030_A_98638	really .
+/3030_B_98639	um , partly because , um , wh , gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining .
sv/3030_B_98640	it 's too rich .
aa/3030_A_98641	oh , it is absolutely .
sd/3030_B_98642	and , so , i , we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day .
b/3030_A_98643	yeah .
%/3030_B_98644	um , so , uh , we , we kind of ,
sd/3030_B_98645	and then one of the couples , uh , moved
sd/3030_B_98646	and so we sort of did n't , did n't continue it ,
sd/3030_B_98647	but , um , and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time , then you , you do n't have as much time for , uh , regular entertaining ,
sd/3030_B_98648	but , um , uh , uh , when , when we entertain i usually try to find something that will be , um , kind of h , good for everybody
sd/3030_B_98649	and that 's ,
b/3030_A_98650	right .
+/3030_B_98651	that sometimes means you ca n't do gourmet ,
b/3030_A_98652	oh , yeah .
+/3030_B_98653	because depending on who your guests are .
aa/3030_A_98654	well , yeah ,
sv/3030_A_98655	that 's true .
sd/3030_A_98656	and we have a gourmet friend that ca n't stand fish
sd/3030_A_98657	so i mean he can get within ,
b/3030_B_98658	oh , yeah ,
sd/3030_B_98659	well , one of my friends does n't eat any cheese at all .
ba/3030_A_98660	oh , my .
sd/3030_B_98661	uh , so that 's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese .
b/3030_A_98662	oh , yeah .
sd/3030_B_98663	uh , well , i take that back .
sd/3030_B_98664	uh , she ca n't eat some cream cheese .
sv/3030_B_98665	but that , that really limits ,
aa/3030_A_98666	it sure d ,
%/3030_B_98667	um ,
sd/3030_A_98668	it makes you , uh , keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out ,
b/3030_B_98669	oh , yeah .
+/3030_A_98670	for something like ,
b/3030_B_98671	right .
b^m/3030_A_98672	right .
sd/3030_A_98673	so we , we try to keep all that in mind ,
%/3030_A_98674	but otherwise , um , i guess , you know , entertaining , um ,
sd/3030_A_98675	i , i guess i have recipes
%/3030_A_98676	i , um ,
sd/3030_A_98677	but that 's , that 's basically what we do is the gourmet ,
b/3030_B_98678	uhhuh .
sd/3030_A_98679	so , you know , they would be pretty elaborate .
b/3030_B_98680	yeah .
sv/3030_A_98681	um , but it 's fun .

sd/3030_B_98730	uh , so , oh , i 'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on .

ba/3030_A_98733	i know .
sd/3030_A_98734	we 're all not built like , uh , what , what , oh ,
^2/3030_B_98735	those people that try to do everything .
+/3030_A_98736	martha stewart , you know .
b/3030_B_98737	yeah .
sd/3030_A_98738	we all are n't martha stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and ,
ba/3030_B_98739	ugh .
+/3030_A_98740	and time to , you know , sh , t ,
qy/3030_B_98741	would n't that be nice ? .
ny/3030_A_98742	yeah .
sd/3030_A_98743	shot a video of the whole thing ,
h/3030_A_98744	i do n't know .
aa/3030_B_98745	yeah ,
aa/3030_B_98746	right .
sv/3030_A_98747	but it 's , it 's really kind of a neat thing .
sd/3030_A_98748	i get a kick out of it .
sd/3030_A_98749	i , i really do .
sd/3030_A_98750	everything , all parts of the food ,
sd/3030_A_98751	i mean
b/3030_B_98752	uhhuh .
+/3030_A_98753	i love to make things from scratch , you know .
b/3030_B_98754	yeah .
+/3030_A_98755	making breads
sv/3030_A_98756	and , and you know people really pretty much appreciate it .
ba/3030_B_98757	oh , they do .
sv/3030_B_98758	i , it 's very difficult to purchase , um , items that are as good as what you can make yourself .
aa/3030_A_98759	oh , i think so .
%/3030_B_98760	um , in spite of , uh ,
sv/3030_B_98761	or if you , if you do buy it , it 's extremely expensive .
sd/3030_B_98762	in fact , uh , i just got back from a shopping trip to purch , purchase the cold cuts
sd/3030_B_98763	and i , i bought turkey and pastrami and , and barbecued ham at a , an amish market near here .
b/3030_A_98764	oh .
sd/3030_B_98765	and i 've never been there before .
b/3030_A_98766	oh .
+/3030_B_98767	and found that there 's , uh , individual vendors
sd/3030_B_98768	and the foods are wonderful .
sd/3030_B_98769	and one of the , uh , the , um , vendors had cakes . all sorts of wonderful cakes . uh , they , fresh str , strawberry cheesecake now and , and so on .
b/3030_A_98770	oh .
sd/3030_B_98771	and it 's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake . um , which is really not such a bad price .
sd/3030_B_98772	i decided i , i just could n't quite make myself , um , buy it because i do make cheesecake
sd/3030_B_98773	and somehow
ba/3030_A_98774	there you go .
+/3030_B_98775	i did n't want to do that because it ,
sd/3030_B_98776	but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful ,
sd/3030_B_98777	and the , they had black forest cherry cake and all those things .
b/3030_A_98778	oh .
sd/3030_B_98779	that ar , but those are homemade .
sd/3030_B_98780	they are not , um , commercial bakery made .
sd/3030_B_98781	and in that they are made in their homes , um ,
sv/3030_B_98782	so it , it 's kind of interesting , uh ,
sd/3030_B_98783	it 's out there if you want to pay the price
%/3030_B_98784	but ,
aa/3030_A_98785	oh , it is .
sd/3030_A_98786	i mean , we have bakeries around here that , you know , you , you just gain weight going by the door ,
b/3030_B_98787	right ,
+/3030_A_98788	you know , just like that .
bf/3030_B_98789	just smelling the air .
%/3030_B_98790	yeah .
aa/3030_A_98791	right ,
h/3030_A_98792	but i do n't know
sv/3030_A_98793	i guess some of the best things i 've ever had , um , i , some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know .
b/3030_B_98794	uhhuh .
sd/3030_A_98795	doing little hors d'oeuvre things that , i have a kick making that , i mean , you know .
b/3030_B_98796	yeah .
sd/3030_A_98797	i get off on strange little details of food , i guess .
sd/3030_A_98798	but
b/3030_B_98799	yeah .
+/3030_A_98800	um , gee , we have so much going on here because you know this is dallas ,
sd/3030_A_98801	this is the southwest ,
sd/3030_A_98802	this is ,
b/3030_B_98803	uhhuh .
+/3030_A_98804	you know , chips and picante sauce and anything hot .
sd/3030_A_98805	you know you can always make it hotter ,
b/3030_B_98806	right .
+/3030_A_98807	and , and lots of stuff like that , you know ,
sv/3030_A_98808	so . that 's , um , a really good party time ,
b/3030_B_98809	yeah .
+/3030_A_98810	eating all that hot food
sv/3030_A_98811	and , and they just love it , you know , down here .

+/3030_A_98815	just , you know ,
sd/3030_A_98816	all the stuff that goes with that ,
%/3030_A_98817	so .
b/3030_B_98818	right .
qy^d/3030_B_98819	you do n't sound like you 're from texas originally though .
ng/3030_A_98820	oh , i 'm not .
ft/3030_A_98821	thank you for noticing .
x/3030_B_98822	.
sd/3030_A_98823	i 'm from chicago .
sd/3030_B_98824	i thought ,
%/3030_A_98825	and how i got ,
+/3030_B_98826	i thought , that there was a slight difference in accent .
b/3030_A_98827	really
sd/3030_A_98828	and how ,
b/3030_B_98829	right .
+/3030_A_98830	i got to texas by way ,
x/3030_B_98831	.
+/3030_A_98832	of virginia i 'm ,
x/3030_B_98833	.
+/3030_A_98834	and everything is a long story .
%/3030_A_98835	but ,
ba/3030_B_98836	i 'll bet .
b/3030_A_98837	yeah .
qy/3030_B_98838	did , um , do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that 's easy
qrr/3030_B_98839	or is it always complicat ,
na/3030_A_98840	well , absolutely .
%/3030_A_98841	i ,
sd/3030_A_98842	in fact , it just came to mind , um ,
%/3030_A_98843	and this ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2024_A_107187	okay .
sv/2024_B_107188	wonderful touch tone telephone there .
qw/2024_A_107189	uh , what kind of books do you enjoy reading ?
^h/2024_B_107190	uh , have n't , have , i have a wide variety of , of hobbies ,
sd/2024_B_107191	therefore , my , my reading pleasures are quite wide .
sd/2024_B_107192	um , i get a charge out of , uh , texas highway ,
b/2024_A_107193	oh .
+/2024_B_107194	which is , uh , very colorful , and , uh , not being a native of texas , but being here eleven years have a tendency to , uh , find out the , uh , about the different areas of the co , of the , of the state by reading it .
b/2024_A_107195	right ,
sd/2024_A_107196	i 've read that one too .
sd/2024_A_107197	i only had a subscription once ,
sd/2024_A_107198	but my mother always gave me hers
sd/2024_A_107199	and i , i really enjoyed , you know , all the little things that you find out about texas .
b/2024_B_107200	oh yeah ,
sv/2024_B_107201	it 's , it 's , uh , absolutely , it 's great the way that it 's broken out and you can , uh , set up little trips and day trips and things .
sv/2024_B_107202	it 's pretty , pretty neat .
sd/2024_B_107203	um , oh , i like photography , um , magazines .
sd/2024_B_107204	i do n't take a subscription or anything like that .
%/2024_B_107205	um , things , oh ,
sd/2024_B_107206	being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of , a lot of , uh , building magazines and , and , and plant engineering magazines and , read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines
sd/2024_B_107207	and ,
b/2024_A_107208	uhhuh .
+/2024_B_107209	and , uh , kind of strange because i , it 's not unusual to , uh , see , uh , an engineering manual or something laying around the house
sd/2024_B_107210	and then i 'll sit up and read just to refresh , uh , you know , to keep active on it ,
%/2024_B_107211	but , uh .
b/2024_A_107212	uhhuh .
qo/2024_B_107213	how about yourself ?
sd/2024_A_107214	well , um , i have an interest in art ,
sd/2024_A_107215	so i , frequently purchase and read , uh , books , mainly on water color because that 's my big interest at the moment .
ba/2024_B_107216	oh , that 's great .
sd/2024_A_107217	and , uh , oh , i guess i like a variety of things , uh , lots of fiction , uh , type books .
sd/2024_A_107218	uh , right now i 'm occasionally reading on a book about , uh , the mardi gras in new orleans and its history .
b/2024_B_107219	uhhuh .
sv/2024_A_107220	that 's fairly interesting .
aa/2024_B_107221	i bet that would be , rather interesting .
sv/2024_B_107222	uh , that 's , uh , self improvement ,
sv/2024_B_107223	that 's , that 's alwa , well , that 's kind of a hobby
sv/2024_B_107224	but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing , uh .
b/2024_A_107225	yeah ,
sd/2024_A_107226	i do n't know that i read anything strictly labeled self improvement .
qo/2024_A_107227	how about you ?
h/2024_B_107228	um , well i hate to ,
ny/2024_B_107229	yes ,
sd/2024_B_107230	i do .
x/2024_A_107231	.
sd/2024_B_107232	we , uh , we have these classes we attend , uh , management classes
sd/2024_B_107233	and , and they give you books
sd/2024_B_107234	and , and the last book , uh , matter of fact i read was , at america 's service by carl albrecht .
sd/2024_B_107235	it talks about , uh , who the customer is and being customer oriented , uh , which falls in line with the t i culture here at texas instruments .
b/2024_A_107236	yeah .
sv/2024_B_107237	uh , one of its great slogans is if you 're not serving the customer , you better be serving someone who is .
b/2024_A_107238	uhhuh .
sv/2024_B_107239	uh , so that 's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is
sd/2024_B_107240	and as you probably well know , all of us are our own customer .
sd/2024_B_107241	you 're my customer , i 'm your customer , sort of thing .
b/2024_A_107242	right .
sd/2024_B_107243	um , every now and then i 'm loaned a tape i can stick in the , uh , in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable , talking about , uh , better outlooks on things and the philosophy of , of pat hagerty and these kind of , uh , mind stimulating philosophy type .
b/2024_A_107244	yeah .
+/2024_B_107245	which all , you know , betters yourself .
b/2024_A_107246	yeah ,
b/2024_A_107247	yeah ,
sd/2024_A_107248	well , uh , maybe i am into some things occasionally that i do n't think of in terms of self improvement .
b/2024_B_107249	uhhuh .
sv/2024_A_107250	i mean they are
sd/2024_A_107251	but i do n't label it as such .
qw^d/2024_B_107252	like what for example .
h/2024_A_107253	well , i do n't know , um ,
sd/2024_A_107254	i , uh , have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them , but , uh , i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things ,
sd/2024_A_107255	but , uh , they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself . you know ge , getting your , yourself in gear to , uh , sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do .
b/2024_B_107256	sure .
+/2024_A_107257	convincing you that you need to get on with it .
b/2024_B_107258	sure .
qy/2024_B_107259	how about items like , um , the one minute manager , which used to be a big ,
%/2024_B_107260	okay .
aa/2024_A_107261	yes .
sv/2024_B_107262	so those are self improvements .
aa/2024_A_107263	sure .
sd/2024_B_107264	um , our supervisor , uh , subtly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know .
%/2024_A_107265	um .
+/2024_B_107266	by a man , man named doctor bittel , b i t t e l
sd/2024_B_107267	and it 's a very layman 's , uh , uh , approach towards managing different types of people .
sd/2024_B_107268	and the very last chapter , and i have n't figured out why that one was last , is how to manage engineers .
x/2024_A_107269	.
sv/2024_B_107270	so it 's , it 's ver , it 's interesting ,
sv/2024_B_107271	here again it 's , it 's casual reading
sd/2024_B_107272	and it 's not eaten up with a lot of , uh , mechanical stuff
sv/2024_B_107273	and it 's really excellent fast reading
sv/2024_B_107274	and , uh , but as you say it 's , it 's sometimes it 's difficult to , to know if it 's , you know ,
sv/2024_B_107275	i think if somebody would say hey , read these ten books because these are selfimprovements , i would probably be turned off to them .
b/2024_A_107276	yeah ,
b/2024_A_107277	yeah .
sd/2024_B_107278	if he casually just walked into it and , uh , put down a stephen king book and i picked up one of them i might be a little more interested .
ar/2024_A_107279	i do n't know ,
sv/2024_A_107280	i 'm not sure i could take too much of stephen king .
sv/2024_A_107281	that 's a little , little heavy for me .
b/2024_B_107282	yeah ,
sv/2024_B_107283	they 're , uh , quite , uh , they 're hard to set down because it 's so interesting
sv/2024_B_107284	and , of course , they 're all just a little spookier than the movies ,
sv/2024_B_107285	but , uh ,
b/2024_A_107286	yeah .
+/2024_B_107287	it 's always , they 're always challenging to get through one of them .
sd/2024_B_107288	i have a hard time finishing books .
sd/2024_A_107289	well i guess i also have been reading , uh , a lot of things on , uh , quality improvement and that type of thing because that 's what i 'm involved in a lot at work .
b/2024_B_107290	uhhuh .
sd/2024_B_107291	in quality , especially now days , uh , that 's almost everything that comes across the , the , the airways .
aa/2024_A_107292	oh , yeah ,
sv/2024_A_107293	you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other
sv/2024_A_107294	but , uh ,
aa/2024_B_107295	exactly , exactly right .
+/2024_A_107296	i think sometimes the word is a little over used
%/2024_A_107297	but ,
sv/2024_B_107298	yeah , we , we have , i think we , we name drop it a little too much and , and do n't fully understand what , what it is we 're saying .
sv/2024_B_107299	i think it 's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk
sv/2024_B_107300	and , and all that kind of rolls in together there ,
b/2024_A_107301	yeah .
sv/2024_B_107302	but , uh , that 's just kind of part of it .
b/2024_A_107303	okay ,
qy/2024_A_107304	well , any other comments .
ng/2024_B_107305	uh , not that i can think of .
sv/2024_B_107306	um , i think i 'm under my quota a little bit .
sd/2024_B_107307	i need to probably make a phone call or two .
sd/2024_A_107308	well we just started ,
%/2024_A_107309	right .
aa/2024_B_107310	uh , this is true .
fc/2024_B_107311	i 've enjoyed it .
fc/2024_A_107312	well you too ,
fc/2024_A_107313	and uh , goodbye .
fc/2024_B_107314	have a good day .

qy/2187_B_109023	do you have a favorite recipe ?
ny/2187_A_109024	um , yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109025	that 's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe ,
sd/2187_A_109026	well , it says , why would you , what you would have for a dinner party .
sd/2187_A_109027	um , this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin .
b/2187_B_109028	oh .
b/2187_A_109029	okay ,
sv/2187_A_109030	maybe , maybe we 're all set .
%/2187_A_109031	okay ,
ad/2187_A_109032	we 'll talk for five minutes ,
sd/2187_A_109033	they interrupt at the end .
%/2187_A_109034	um , yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109035	it says what you would have for a dinner party ,
sd/2187_A_109036	i just happen to plan one out for saturday
sd/2187_A_109037	i 'll tell you ,
ba/2187_B_109038	oh , that 's wonderful .
+/2187_A_109039	what i 'm going to have .
b/2187_B_109040	okay .
+/2187_A_109041	um , if i can find it .
sd/2187_A_109042	well , i have this new fondue pot
sd/2187_A_109043	and i was going to do basic cheese fondue ,
sd/2187_A_109044	and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham
sd/2187_A_109045	and i was going to try something weird which , you know ,
sd/2187_A_109046	when you have fish au gratin ,
sd/2187_A_109047	i was going to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue .
sd/2187_A_109048	i do n't know if it will come out .
%/2187_B_109049	that 's ,
qy/2187_B_109050	what kind of fondue , the cheese dip or ,
ny/2187_A_109051	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109052	the cheese fondue i make ,
sd/2187_A_109053	some people like swiss , um ,
sd/2187_A_109054	i prefer cheddar .
sd/2187_A_109055	and i 'll mix ,
sd/2187_A_109056	i wo n't make , i wo n't have a sharp cheddar because it , for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp ,
b/2187_B_109057	right .
+/2187_A_109058	cheddar .
b/2187_B_109059	yeah .
sd/2187_A_109060	and then i was going to make other things like potato skins .
ba/2187_B_109061	oh , that sounds good .
sd/2187_A_109062	it , see you do n't necessarily have to dip this stuff .
sd/2187_A_109063	and , um , i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a , a vegetable .
sv/2187_B_109064	that 's always a good thing .
sv/2187_B_109065	vegetable trays always go over so well , because i think people get tired of eating junk .
sv/2187_B_109066	i mean , i think they like to have healthy stuff too ,
%/2187_B_109067	you know it 's ,
aa/2187_A_109068	oh , yeah ,
sv/2187_A_109069	it 's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party .
aa/2187_B_109070	oh , definitely .
sv/2187_B_109071	i think better even than , than other kinds of food .
aa/2187_A_109072	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109073	instead of something greasy or ,
aa/2187_B_109074	right ,
aa/2187_B_109075	exactly .
%/2187_B_109076	yeah .
sd/2187_A_109077	my , uh , girlfriends do catering
sd/2187_A_109078	and they always , about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray .
sd/2187_A_109079	i think they try and suggest it .
b/2187_B_109080	uhhuh .
sd/2187_A_109081	what i 've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something , i make , uh , food kabobs .
sd/2187_A_109082	you take little toothpicks and cut up ,
b/2187_B_109083	oh .
+/2187_A_109084	uh , pineapple and strawberry ,
b/2187_B_109085	yes .
+/2187_A_109086	and even banana if you can do it just before you leave .
b/2187_B_109087	right .
sd/2187_A_109088	it stays nice and fresh .
aa/2187_B_109089	right ,
sv/2187_B_109090	that 's true .
qy/2187_B_109091	or even have you ever seen where they , they 'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out ,
ny/2187_A_109092	yeah .
+/2187_B_109093	and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat .
b/2187_A_109094	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109095	i like those .
b/2187_B_109096	yep .
sd/2187_A_109097	um , they , they made a couple of those , uh ,
sd/2187_A_109098	they made one for my , uh , bridal shower
sd/2187_A_109099	and i was pretty pleased .
sd/2187_A_109100	i never made one for myself though .
sv/2187_A_109101	but they look easy enough to make
%/2187_A_109102	it 's not ,
sv/2187_B_109103	oh , i think it would , it would be a lot of work
h/2187_B_109104	but , um ,
b/2187_A_109105	yeah .
+/2187_B_109106	you know , because it 's , you know ,
sv/2187_B_109107	you have to cut each thing or , you know , use the melon baller and stuff
sv/2187_B_109108	but , but i think they 're really neat
sv/2187_B_109109	and , you know , i think they 're worth the time , you know , because they ,
b/2187_A_109110	yeah ,
sv/2187_A_109111	you probably get this , probably pretty sticky after you get done .
b/2187_B_109112	oh , yeah
x/2187_B_109113	.
sd/2187_A_109114	then you 've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because , you know , when you scrape it , it makes the water .
b/2187_B_109115	right .
b/2187_B_109116	yeah .
b/2187_A_109117	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109118	um , something i do is a fruit ,
sd/2187_A_109119	is , i 'll get , um , make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them .
%/2187_A_109120	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109121	i have two nieces
sd/2187_A_109122	and they , they they go melt some chocolate chips , .
^q/2187_A_109123	go buy me some strawberries .
qy/2187_B_109124	is that , is that good ?
sd/2187_B_109125	you know , i 've seen that so many times , strawberries dipped in chocolate
sd/2187_B_109126	but i 've never tried it ,
qy/2187_B_109127	are they really good ?
ny/2187_A_109128	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109129	ther , you know , if you get a sweet strawberry they 're much better ,
sd/2187_A_109130	but if you get a sour strawberry ,
qy/2187_B_109131	oh , i bet it does n't mix well , does it ?
ny/2187_A_109132	huh . yeah ,
nn/2187_A_109133	no ,
sd/2187_A_109134	they , um , the strawberries are coming in season now from ,
sd/2187_A_109135	they 're , they 're coming up from florida , of course .
sd/2187_A_109136	i live in vermont ,
sd/2187_A_109137	so . but they 're really reasonably priced ,
sd/2187_A_109138	they 're coming up from florida ,
%/2187_A_109139	so .
ba/2187_B_109140	oh , well , that 's good
sd/2187_B_109141	because i know they 've been really expensive lately .
b/2187_A_109142	yeah .
+/2187_B_109143	because they were n't in season ,
sd/2187_B_109144	of course , they had to be , be , uh , grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
b/2187_A_109145	yeah ,
sv/2187_A_109146	i think the , uh , actually i think they get , um , some of them from south america .
bh/2187_B_109147	oh , is that right ?
ny/2187_A_109148	yep ,
%/2187_A_109149	they ,
sd/2187_A_109150	a lot of , um , of a , um , winter produce comes from south america .
%/2187_B_109151	oh , i .
sd/2187_A_109152	of course , their seasons are switched .
b/2187_B_109153	uhhuh .
b/2187_B_109154	right .
qy/2187_A_109155	so , um , do you want to discuss the recipe ?
arp_nd/2187_B_109156	well ,
oo_co_cc/2187_A_109157	i have a recipe if you want .
aa/2187_B_109158	okay ,
aa/2187_B_109159	sure , su ,
%/2187_A_109160	um , it filled ,
sv/2187_A_109161	a lot of people try to stay away from this
sd/2187_A_109162	but i make my own homemade pudding just because i do n't like box pudding .
bh/2187_B_109163	is that right ?
sd/2187_B_109164	i 've never heard of that .
ny/2187_A_109165	yeah ,
%/2187_A_109166	it , and it if you , um , well ,
sd/2187_A_109167	first of all i take about a quarter and a half of milk
sd/2187_A_109168	and i put it in a two quart saucepan
ad/2187_A_109169	and you put it on a really low heat .
b/2187_B_109170	uhhuh .
ad/2187_A_109171	and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it , it ends up burning ,
sd/2187_A_109172	i mean , no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot .
b/2187_B_109173	uhhuh .
sd/2187_A_109174	i do n't let that worry me .
sd/2187_A_109175	and i get the milk lukewarm
sd/2187_A_109176	and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it
sd/2187_A_109177	and i have this thing
sd/2187_A_109178	it 's called the slender blender ,
sd/2187_A_109179	it , it makes the , uh , it makes , uh , a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough .
h/2187_A_109180	it 's , uh , i do n't know ,
sd/2187_A_109181	they 're called moo goo leaves or something
%/2187_A_109182	they 're sl ,
sv/2187_B_109183	i think i know what you 're talk ,
qy/2187_B_109184	is it like a hand held ?
ny/2187_A_109185	yeah .
sv/2187_A_109186	they 're real neat .
%/2187_B_109187	the ,
bk/2187_B_109188	yeah ,
bk/2187_B_109189	okay .
sv/2187_A_109190	i think they 're real reasonably priced ,
sd/2187_A_109191	some of them , they used to be a hundred dollars ,
sd/2187_A_109192	and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert
sd/2187_A_109193	but i did n't get that one ,
sd/2187_A_109194	i got the black and decker kind .
sv/2187_A_109195	but , uh , it 's real handy because it does n't have a cord
ad/2187_A_109196	and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil , the milk , you know ,
sv/2187_A_109197	and it does an excellent job ,
sd/2187_A_109198	or just hand beat it .
sd/2187_A_109199	i guess you could use a hand mixer
sv/2187_A_109200	but i do n't think it pur , i do n't think it gets it good enough .
b/2187_B_109201	uhhuh .
sd/2187_A_109202	and then before the milk gets too hot , um , i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good . and then about a half a cup of sugar
sd/2187_A_109203	and i let it pretty much ,
sd/2187_A_109204	i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds
sd/2187_A_109205	and it 's , it starts thickening ,
sd/2187_A_109206	when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little , i do n't know ,
sd/2187_A_109207	it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch ,
ad/2187_A_109208	and you just keep beating it in .
%/2187_A_109209	and it 's the ,
sd/2187_A_109210	the trick is , is to have this blender ,
%/2187_A_109211	so , if you were ,
sv/2187_A_109212	you 'd have to probably almost go out
sd/2187_A_109213	and someone who 's just going to make it first time , it 's ,
sd/2187_A_109214	you 'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders .
+/2187_B_109215	huh .
sd/2187_A_109216	and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate
sd/2187_A_109217	or after it 's thickened i cook it for a good ,
sd/2187_A_109218	once it starts boiling , i just , i cook it for a good seven minutes ,
b/2187_B_109219	uhhuh .
+/2187_A_109220	seven to ten minutes
sd/2187_A_109221	and then you can make chocolate
sd/2187_A_109222	or you can take it off and let it cool
sd/2187_A_109223	you put , um , really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter
sd/2187_A_109224	and that makes french vanilla , um , custard .
%/2187_A_109225	yeah ,
ba/2187_B_109226	oh , wow .
sv/2187_B_109227	that is really interesting .
br/2187_B_109228	are you saying to use like , um , for chocolate like , unsweetened ,
sd/2187_A_109229	a chocolate powder .
br/2187_B_109230	unsweetened ?
ny/2187_A_109231	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109232	that cocoa , yeah , the unsweetened .
sd/2187_A_109233	it comes in like a real dark can ,
b/2187_B_109234	yeah .
sd/2187_A_109235	our mothers used to use it .
%/2187_A_109236	and then ,
sd/2187_B_109237	ri , i have some .
b/2187_A_109238	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109239	we all used to ,
sd/2187_B_109240	i just want to ,
b/2187_A_109241	yeah
sd/2187_A_109242	, it 's the unsweetened kind
sd/2187_A_109243	it 's not like nestles quik .
b/2187_B_109244	right .
bk/2187_B_109245	okay .
sv/2187_A_109246	i suppose you could use that .
%/2187_A_109247	i ,
bf/2187_B_109248	cooking chocolate .
ny/2187_A_109249	yeah ,
%/2187_A_109250	but , um ,
sv/2187_B_109251	that 's really interesting ,
sd/2187_B_109252	i 've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that 's really neat .
sd/2187_A_109253	well , i used to make the regular pudding , the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
sd/2187_A_109254	and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie , it would soak into the pie shell
sd/2187_A_109255	and it was like red ,
sd/2187_A_109256	and i 'm like , oh ,
^q/2187_A_109257	this is kind of groedy .
qw/2187_B_109258	well , how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own ?
sd/2187_A_109259	um , actually i found it in one of my mother 's , um , homemade cookbooks ,
sd/2187_A_109260	i mean ,
bh/2187_B_109261	is that right ?
+/2187_A_109262	something she had collected out of woman 's day or something .
ba/2187_B_109263	oh , neat ,
%/2187_A_109264	so ,
sv/2187_B_109265	that is just really neat .
%/2187_B_109266	because i ,
sv/2187_A_109267	i think you could n't make it with a hand whisk or , or a regular beater
%/2187_A_109268	but , um ,
bf/2187_B_109269	it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good .
ny/2187_A_109270	yeah ,
sv/2187_A_109271	but i still think a beater would do it good enough , um ,
sd/2187_A_109272	the trick is to get the cornstarch ,
b/2187_B_109273	uhhuh .
%/2187_A_109274	um , yeah
sd/2187_A_109275	, right in the , in the lukewarm milk .
sd/2187_A_109276	sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl
sd/2187_A_109277	and i would put it in the sink
sd/2187_A_109278	and i 'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good .
sv/2187_A_109279	it seems to be better than putting the , the cornstarch into the liquid
sd/2187_A_109280	it , once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top .
qy^d/2187_B_109281	so you put the milk in the cornstarch ?
ny/2187_A_109282	yeah .
sd/2187_A_109283	and i 'll do this , uh ,
sd/2187_A_109284	sometimes i 'll put my after i pour that into my , back into my saucepan .
sd/2187_A_109285	i 'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg .
%/2187_A_109286	so ,
qy^d/2187_B_109287	and then put that back in the saucepan ?
ny/2187_A_109288	yep .
sd/2187_A_109289	and then , you know , if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to . the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more .
%/2187_B_109290	huh that 's ,
sd/2187_A_109291	because by the vanilla does n't seem to thicken as well as the ,
%/2187_A_109292	sometimes the cocoa is
sd/2187_A_109293	like , my husband really likes it thick
sd/2187_A_109294	he says , i can stick the spoon right in this .
b/2187_B_109295	oh .
sd/2187_A_109296	because i 'm always worrying it wo n't firm up because it , when you take it out of the saucepan it 's like , boy , i hope this thickens a little more because it 's not like real package thick , you know ,
sd/2187_A_109297	when you cook a package ,
b/2187_B_109298	uhhuh .
+/2187_A_109299	it 's , it 's a little less ,
sd/2187_A_109300	but i put it in a nice glass bowl
sv/2187_A_109301	and , um , some people do n't like that , that , film on the pudding
sd/2187_A_109302	so you can put , uh , saran wrap over the top .
b/2187_B_109303	uhhuh .
sd/2187_A_109304	and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap ,
sd/2187_A_109305	so , when you pull the saran wrap back , you sort of should be a little careful , pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap
sd/2187_A_109306	and i might put it back on .
%/2187_A_109307	but , um ,
qy/2187_B_109308	do yo , do you put it in the refrigerator then
%/2187_B_109309	or y ,
ny/2187_A_109310	yeah ,
sd/2187_A_109311	after , well when it starts steaming a lot , uh , i definitely , yeah , put it in the refrigerator ,
b/2187_B_109312	uhhuh .
%/2187_A_109313	but , um , i ,
sd/2187_A_109314	my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you 're going to make it work too hard .
b/2187_B_109315	right ,
sv/2187_B_109316	that 's true .
sd/2187_B_109317	i knew that .
%/2187_A_109318	that 's ,
b/2187_A_109319	yeah ,
b/2187_B_109320	yeah .
sd/2187_A_109321	so , , that 's why i do that .
b/2187_B_109322	yeah .
h/2187_A_109323	so , well , i do n't know
sd/2187_A_109324	that 's my , my great hard recipe .
qw/3190_A_111358	where have you been on a wonderful vacation ?
sd/3190_B_111359	well normally when we go on vacation we go home , to colorado .
sd/3190_A_111360	oh , that 's where we go home , too .
b/3190_B_111361	really .
b/3190_B_111362	yeah ,
sd/3190_B_111363	colorado springs is where we 're from .

b/3190_B_111440	really .
sd/3190_A_111441	we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise ,
sd/3190_A_111442	so they said we could either cancel , reschedule , or take whatever was available .
sd/3190_A_111443	so we took whatever was available ,

sd/3190_A_111445	and they put us up at the cocoa beach hilton ,
sd/3190_A_111446	and the ship that was available , the only , uh , rooms that had n't been booked were the suites .

sv/3190_B_111462	i bet .
sd/3190_B_111463	that sounds like the way i 'd want to do it
b/3190_A_111464	yes .
+/3190_B_111465	i think .
qo/3190_A_111466	well , what kind of things do you like to do when you go to colorado ?
sd/3190_B_111467	oh , well , we like to ski , of course ,

b/3190_A_111469	yes .
+/3190_B_111470	uh , and seeing our friends ,
sd/3190_B_111471	because we moved to texas about two years ago . so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do
b/3190_A_111472	yeah .
sd/3190_B_111473	so we do n't , we do n't get a lot of time to just vacation .
sd/3190_B_111474	we did , um , last year , though , go to san antonio for memorial day
b/3190_A_111475	oh .
+/3190_B_111476	which was fun just to get to kind of walk around
b/3190_A_111477	uhhuh .
+/3190_B_111478	and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing .
sv/3190_B_111479	uh , but , you know , other , other than that , with , with both my kids being under two , it 's real hard
b/3190_A_111480	right .
+/3190_B_111481	to do any , any kind of
%/3190_A_111482	that would be ,
+/3190_B_111483	events that , uh
b/3190_A_111484	yes .
+/3190_B_111485	do n't , do n't require as much ,
b/3190_A_111486	i know ,
sd/3190_A_111487	i think one of the places i always hit in colorado , is that current outlet store .
b/3190_B_111488	yeah
br/3190_A_111489	that 's what ,

b/3190_A_111511	oh .
b/3190_B_111512	yeah ,

b/3190_B_111515	yeah ,
sv/3190_B_111516	driving for thanksgiving , that 's going to be quite a drive for ,
aa/3190_A_111517	well it was when we left last year .

sd/3190_A_111530	that 's on like route two eightyseven or something like that .
b/3190_B_111531	yeah ,
b/3190_B_111532	uhhuh ,
sd/3190_B_111533	and then we go straight up through trinidad

+/3190_B_111535	and straight up i twentyfive from there .
bk/3190_A_111536	okay ,
sd/3190_A_111537	we , uh , went a different way when we went last christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little u haul trailer ,
sd/3190_A_111538	because we had to take our dog in the car , there was no room for luggage .
sd/3190_A_111539	so , we went all interstate .
sd/3190_A_111540	we went up , um , through oklahoma city
b/3190_B_111541	uhhuh .
+/3190_A_111542	and then up through , uh , kansas , and then turned left and went in on i seventy
b/3190_B_111543	oh .
sd/3190_A_111544	and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour .
sd/3190_A_111545	it was a little more mile wise
b/3190_B_111546	uhhuh .
sd/3190_A_111547	but because you could go sixtyfive miles an hour on the ,
qy/3201_A_128831	so do you have any recycling programs there ?
ng/3201_B_128832	um , i do n't really think we have anything in the works as of yet .
b/3201_A_128833	uhhuh .
sd/3201_B_128834	uh , we 're a pretty small town
sd/3201_B_128835	and , uh , the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of walmart
b/3201_A_128836	oh , uhhuh .
+/3201_B_128837	that show , you know , plastics , paper
b/3201_A_128838	yeah .
+/3201_B_128839	liter bottles , et cetera , et cetera .
sd/3201_A_128840	we 've progressed a little bit farther than that .
b/3201_B_128841	yeah .
sd/3201_A_128842	um , actually they have , uh ,
sd/3201_A_128843	parts of town ,
sd/3201_A_128844	it may have even spread all over the whole town ,
sd/3201_A_128845	and , um , they will have these green bins
b/3201_B_128846	uhhuh .
sd/3201_A_128847	and it 's just as standard as a , a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump .
b/3201_B_128848	yeah .
sd/3201_A_128849	and , uh , just along with a trash can you have this , this green plastic bin ,
sd/3201_A_128850	and you put your bottles in it and paper and , uh , you know , all those things that wh ,
sd/3201_A_128851	aluminum .
sd/3201_A_128852	you know , anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin .
b/3201_B_128853	oh .
sd/3201_A_128854	and , uh , i guess you can al ,
sd/3201_A_128855	and a lot of the restaurants
b/3201_B_128856	yeah .
+/3201_A_128857	they just have , uh , places where you can throw away , especially beer places , where you can throw away green bottles ,
%/3201_B_128858	huh .
+/3201_A_128859	and then the brown bottles .
h/3201_A_128860	and , uh , oh , i do n't know ,
sd/3201_A_128861	i guess they 're , you know , clear bottles .
b/3201_B_128862	yeah .
sd/3201_A_128863	so , um , you know a lot of people do have those separated .
sd/3201_A_128864	and , of course , they have the , um , dumpsters , uh , the , the igloos .
b/3201_B_128865	yeah .
sd/3201_A_128866	uh , and they have those strateg , strategically placed around the city .
b/3201_B_128867	oh .
sd/3201_A_128868	and , uh , they 're , they 're actually going to extend it , i think , one of these days maybe to apartment complexes
%/3201_A_128869	and , uh ,
sv/3201_B_128870	oh , that would be good .
b/3201_A_128871	yeah ,
h/3201_A_128872	things of that nature .
sv/3201_A_128873	so , i guess when you live in a bigger city it , it really becomes , uh ,
b/3201_B_128874	yeah ,
sd/3201_B_128875	see ,
+/3201_A_128876	necessary .
+/3201_B_128877	it 's not anywhere near that .
%/3201_B_128878	uh , we , you know ,
sd/3201_B_128879	as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans .
b/3201_A_128880	oh , yeah .
sd/3201_B_128881	but that 's as far as we go
sd/3201_B_128882	because i take them to a girl at work ,
sd/3201_B_128883	and she goes and cashes them in because , you know ,
sd/3201_B_128884	i just
b/3201_A_128885	uhhuh .
+/3201_B_128886	i can do that for her
sd/3201_B_128887	and
b/3201_A_128888	yeah .
+/3201_B_128889	and i do n't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it .
bh/3201_A_128890	oh , really ?
ny/3201_B_128891	yeah ,
%/3201_A_128892	huh .
sd/3201_B_128893	see we do n't have anything here in belton .
sd/3201_B_128894	it 's , it 's a pretty small little town .
b/3201_A_128895	yeah ,
sd/3201_A_128896	i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans .
b/3201_B_128897	yeah .
%/3201_A_128898	and , uh ,
sd/3201_B_128899	so , you know , that 's about all the , that we 're doing here .
sd/3201_B_128900	uh , they 're , uh , getting a little bit more on ,
sv/3201_B_128901	they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle , and what can you recycle and what you ca n't .
b/3201_A_128902	uhhuh .
+/3201_B_128903	because , you know , not a lot of people do really know what , you know , what it 's for .
b/3201_A_128904	yeah ,
sd/3201_A_128905	they 're doing a real good job of , uh , separating it here .
sd/3201_A_128906	and , of course , there you know you have a specific place to put your paper .
b/3201_B_128907	yeah .
sd/3201_A_128908	and , uh , they try to get you to go ahead and separate it ,
sd/3201_A_128909	but they actually have the door to door pickup .
sd/3201_A_128910	um , and it 's , uh , i think it started out to be , um , just kind of a test , a pilot project .
b/3201_B_128911	uhhuh .
sd/3201_A_128912	and it went over so well that they just extended it .
sd/3201_A_128913	and it 's almost , uh ,
sd/3201_A_128914	i do n't know if it 's done by a private company or not .
sd/3201_A_128915	it may be .
sd/3201_A_128916	but , uh , they just go around to each , uh , door and pick it up .
ba/3201_B_128917	wow , that 's excellent .
b/3201_A_128918	yeah .
ba/3201_B_128919	that 's good .
^h/3201_A_128920	let 's see .
sd/3201_A_128921	oh , and every year , of course , the phone books
b/3201_B_128922	yeah .
+/3201_A_128923	um , they tell everybody across the city to , uh , put all their phone books in , uh , the , uh , recycle bins .
b/3201_B_128924	oh .
sd/3201_A_128925	because , you know , phone books are pretty ,
sd/3201_A_128926	well , for a bigger city they 're pretty thick .
aa/3201_B_128927	yeah ,
sd/3201_B_128928	they are .
sd/3201_A_128929	and sometimes you might have two or three .
aa/3201_B_128930	exactly .
sv/3201_A_128931	so , uh , that 's , that 's a big savings right there in itself .
aa/3201_B_128932	yeah ,
sd/3201_B_128933	see ours just goes in the regular trash .
b/3201_A_128934	yeah ,
sd/3201_B_128935	it just ,
%/3201_A_128936	huh .
+/3201_B_128937	you know , there 's not a whole lot .
sd/3201_B_128938	and there are , you know , some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff .
b/3201_A_128939	uhhuh .
sd/3201_B_128940	but usually it 's , it , it has n't caught on yet .
sd/3201_B_128941	i 'm hoping it will soon .
b/3201_A_128942	uhhuh .
sd/3201_A_128943	well , the thing about newspapers and paper ,
sd/3201_A_128944	recycled paper is actually very expensive .
b/3201_B_128945	yeah .
sd/3201_A_128946	so , when you see something that 's on recycled paper , they 've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that .
b/3201_A_128947	it 's , uh ,
sd/3201_A_128948	they 're not coming out ahead at all .
sd/3201_A_128949	it 's , uh , it 's really a cost .
sd/3201_B_128950	huh . i was n't totally aware of that .
b/3201_A_128951	yeah .
%/3201_B_128952	so .
sv/3201_A_128953	i mean it , it sounds good to the public
sd/3201_A_128954	but there 's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something .
sd/3201_A_128955	now , aluminum i do n't know .
sv/3201_A_128956	they may be coming out ahead .

sv/3028_A_156710	and they , they form it ,
sv/3028_A_156711	and they make it look like roast beef ,

%/3028_B_156720	that 's what ,
+/3028_A_156721	from one of , somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about .
ba/3028_B_156722	oh , my goodness .
b/3028_A_156723	uhhuh .
sd/3028_B_156724	i 'm surprised .

ny/3028_B_156727	yeah .

qo/3028_A_156735	how about the health food , uh , restaurants ? well , like this one
qy/3028_A_156736	but it 's probably not advertised as such , is it ?
%/3028_A_156737	or ,
qy/3028_B_156738	a health food ?
ny/3028_A_156739	uhhuh .
sd/3028_A_156740	health food , uh , restaurants that ,
%/3028_B_156741	like , like ,
ad/3028_B_156742	name one .
aa/3028_A_156743	well
sd/3028_B_156744	i 'm not sure what you 're talking about .
+/3028_A_156745	well , like , um , well , i ca n't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there 's so few and far between .
sd/3028_A_156746	but they ought , there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious . you know , as far as their cholesterol levels and their , their fat content and , you know , the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product
sd/3028_A_156747	and they list them .
sd/3028_A_156748	now there 's one restaurant that does that
sd/3028_A_156749	and it 's called rodolfo 's
sd/3028_A_156750	over on preston road and royal lane i believe .
b/3028_B_156751	huh .
sd/3028_A_156752	and they r , have very good food over there .
sd/3028_B_156753	i do n't guess i 've ever been to anything like that
sd/3028_B_156754	so ,
b/3028_A_156755	uhhuh ,
b/3028_A_156756	uhhuh .
+/3028_B_156757	i really do n't have anything to compare it to .
sd/3028_A_156758	they do list , um , you know , list the fat ,
sv/3028_B_156759	it would be good i think ,
aa/3028_A_156760	uhhuh ,
aa/3028_A_156761	uhhuh .
qw^d/3028_B_156762	uh , i do n't know how expensive they are .
sv/3028_B_156763	it sounds like that it would probably ,
sv/3028_A_156764	well , it was pretty reasonable .
sd/3028_A_156765	i , it was around ten dollars for lunch . okay ,
sv/3028_A_156766	wha , which is kind of high for lunch i guess .
qy/3028_B_156767	for one person ?
ny/3028_A_156768	yes .
bk/3028_B_156769	oh .
ny/3028_A_156770	yes ,
ny/3028_A_156771	uhhuh .
sv/3028_B_156772	a bit .
aa/3028_A_156773	yeah .
sd/3028_A_156774	uh , but ,
x/3028_B_156775	.
+/3028_A_156776	um , you were served by maitre d 's and , and , uh , um , men waiters .
b/3028_B_156777	yeah ,
sd/3028_B_156778	i , i wo n't really be interested in going to , in going there .
sv/3028_A_156779	well ,
+/3028_B_156780	because ,
+/3028_A_156781	if you 're looking for a nice ,
+/3028_B_156782	i feel like i 'm , i 'm paying , you know , five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without .
b/3028_A_156783	uhhuh .
sv/3028_A_156784	well , i guess if you were having , if you were trying to impress somebody w , like taking somebody that you had n't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant .
aa/3028_B_156785	yeah .
aa/3028_B_156786	maybe ,
+/3028_A_156787	it 's a special occasion ,
+/3028_B_156788	maybe that .
aa/3028_B_156789	yeah .
+/3028_A_156790	type thing .
%/3028_A_156791	yeah .
aa/3028_B_156792	yeah .
aa/3028_B_156793	i could see that ,
b/3028_A_156794	uhhuh .
+/3028_B_156795	then maybe .
sv/3028_A_156796	and now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime .
aa/3028_B_156797	yeah ,
sd/3028_B_156798	i like the ,
%/3028_A_156799	because they 're ,
+/3028_B_156800	the seafood that they , when they had it , you know , the broiled ,
%/3028_A_156801	well , they have lunch specials that
sv/3028_A_156802	you ca n't , you ca n't beat that price , uh , if you went to a cafeteria .
aa/3028_B_156803	yeah .
aa/3028_B_156804	probably that 's true .
sv/3028_B_156805	but i know a lot of their , a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things ,
sd/3028_A_156806	well , i had the ,
+/3028_B_156807	that you ca n't really get away from the fried ,
+/3028_A_156808	i had a broiled chicken breast
sd/3028_A_156809	and it was excellent .
sd/3028_A_156810	it was a marinated , broiled chicken breast
sd/3028_A_156811	and it was exce ,
qw/3028_B_156812	now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken ?
sd/3028_A_156813	oh , it was ,
sd/3028_B_156814	that 's one of my husband 's pet peeves .
sd/3028_B_156815	he does n't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak , you know .
sd/3028_A_156816	well , i 've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i 'm from the north
sd/3028_A_156817	and that was a no no .
bh/3028_B_156818	oh , really ?
sd/3028_A_156819	and i have n't gotten over that from the north .
sv/3028_B_156820	oh , catfish is wonderful .
sd/3028_A_156821	i know they say that ,
b/3028_B_156822	oh , really .
+/3028_A_156823	that is ,
sd/3028_A_156824	but i 'm ,
b/3028_B_156825	really .
+/3028_A_156826	but they 've got all these caution signs now on fish
sd/3028_A_156827	and so i kind of stay a ,
qw/3028_B_156828	why ?
sv/3028_A_156829	because of all the pollution in the lakes and the ,
bk/3028_B_156830	oh .
+/3028_A_156831	everywhere . i mean there is n't any safe haven anymore for fish .
b/3028_B_156832	huh .
sd/3028_A_156833	i , and especially , uh , in wisconsin and michigan they say , no , buying of our fish .
sd/3028_B_156834	that 's too bad ,
%/3028_A_156835	i ,
+/3028_B_156836	because i 'm probably not going to stop eating it .
b/3028_A_156837	well , yeah .
%/3028_A_156838	so yo , i am ,
sv/3028_A_156839	and the , the best brand of chicken to buy is the , uh , pilgrim pride because they do n't use all these hormones to remote , uh , unnatural growth in their products .
b/3028_B_156840	uhhuh .
b/3028_B_156841	yeah .
sv/3028_A_156842	so i mean , we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy .
aa/3028_B_156843	that 's true .
%/3028_A_156844	so i 'm , i , you know , i ,
sd/3028_B_156845	oh , on one hand i see that
sd/3028_B_156846	and on the other hand , uh , my older sister
b/3028_A_156847	uhhuh .
+/3028_B_156848	remembers when , uh , at one point they were taking radioactive wastes
b/3028_A_156849	yeah .
+/3028_B_156850	and storing them in tin barrels which i , i guess ,
^2/3028_A_156851	corrode .
+/3028_B_156852	had a halflife of , oh , five years if they sit empty on dry land .
b/3028_A_156853	huh .
sd/3028_B_156854	so they 're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically .
b/3028_A_156855	uhhuh .
sd/3028_B_156856	and then they take these things that will rust
sd/3028_B_156857	and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more .
sd/3028_A_156858	well , i 'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good .
b/3028_B_156859	oh .
sd/3028_B_156860	and then they would n't think .
sd/3028_B_156861	they were floating around
sd/3028_B_156862	so they shot holes in them to sink them .
ba/3028_A_156863	oh , dear .
sd/3028_B_156864	and this is before i was born .
ba/3028_A_156865	wow .
sd/3028_B_156866	so , i mean we 're taking thirty years ago ,
b/3028_A_156867	sure .
+/3028_B_156868	this happened ,
b/3028_A_156869	yeah .
sv/3028_B_156870	and , and who 's , you know , the tuna is radioactive
aa/3028_A_156871	that 's right .
sv/3028_A_156872	everything we eat .
+/3028_B_156873	to a certain extent .
sv/3028_A_156874	everything ,
sv/3028_B_156875	you ca n't get away from it
%/3028_B_156876	so i think ,
+/3028_A_156877	everything we eat should have a label on it .
+/3028_B_156878	to some point ,
b/3028_A_156879	yeah .
b^m/3028_B_156880	yeah ,
sv/3028_B_156881	you know . so there 's , you know , there 's some things i think we can av , we , you know we ca n't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like , you know ,
sv/3028_B_156882	this is not in my control .
%/3028_A_156883	well , you know ,
sv/3028_B_156884	so i 'm either going to be , i 'm either going to starve to death
sv/3028_B_156885	or i 'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can , you know .
sv/3028_A_156886	well , becky , you know , even if you lived off your own land , that you would have to put caution signs ,
qy/2545_A_199591	um , so do you have a personal computer ?
sd/2545_B_199592	uh , well we do have one in , in our home , uh ,
sd/2545_B_199593	it 's on the fritz right now , because the monitor is n't working properly
sd/2545_B_199594	but , uh , it has been , uh , used tremendously , mostly by my children for , uh , playing games .
b/2545_A_199595	oh .
sd/2545_B_199596	however , um , you know , the bane of our existence these days ,
sd/2545_B_199597	uh , but it does have a word processing program , which all of us have used for re , reports and papers and that sort of thing .
b/2545_A_199598	yeah ,
%/2545_A_199599	that 's what ,
sd/2545_A_199600	when this subject was mentioned to us i said , well ,
sd/2545_A_199601	i went , gee , that 's all i use mine for is a word processor ,
^q/2545_A_199602	and i have n't used it since i got out of college ,
sd/2545_A_199603	and that was six years ago ,
ba/2545_B_199604	oh , wow .
sd/2545_A_199605	but it , it was my sister 's who ,
sd/2545_A_199606	my sister bought it
b/2545_B_199607	uhhuh .
sd/2545_A_199608	and , uh , my father had a small business
sd/2545_A_199609	and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business ,
sd/2545_A_199610	and he never did ,
b/2545_B_199611	oh .
sd/2545_A_199612	he always did everything out by hand .
sd/2545_A_199613	he only had three employees ,
b/2545_B_199614	oh , yeah .
sv/2545_A_199615	so , you know , it was n't really worth it to him to do , to do it .
b/2545_B_199616	yeah .
arp_nd/2545_B_199617	actually , it would be worth it , if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand .
aa/2545_A_199618	yeah ,
sv/2545_A_199619	like pay , the payroll
%/2545_A_199620	and ,
aa/2545_B_199621	exactly ,
sd/2545_B_199622	and there are ,
b/2545_A_199623	yeah ,
sd/2545_A_199624	basically payroll .
+/2545_B_199625	lots of them on the market .
b/2545_A_199626	yeah .
sd/2545_B_199627	but you do have to research that , find out what works for your system .
qw/2545_B_199628	what kind do you have ?
sd/2545_A_199629	um , it 's an i b m ,
sd/2545_A_199630	i think it 's a professional three hundred ,
ar/2545_A_199631	no ,
sd/2545_A_199632	that 's , that 's the digital one .
sd/2545_A_199633	it 's an , uh , i b m p c junior , i think .
ba/2545_B_199634	oh , well , that 's a nice computer .
aa/2545_A_199635	yeah
sd/2545_A_199636	she , she , uh , she uses it now , uh , my sister , to ,
sd/2545_A_199637	actually , she moved
b/2545_B_199638	uhhuh ,
bf/2545_B_199639	so she took it with her .
+/2545_A_199640	she took it with her , *sd
b/2545_B_199641	yeah ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2545_B_199642	do n't blame her .
+/2545_A_199643	because she needed it to do ,
sd/2545_A_199644	she just finished up her bachelor 's degree
b/2545_B_199645	uhhuh .
sd/2545_A_199646	so i do n't know if she 's going to even use it anymore .
%/2545_A_199647	it , it 's ,
b/2545_B_199648	yeah .
ad/2545_B_199649	oh , well , well , encourage her to try other things ,
%/2545_B_199650	because , um , i am , uh ,
sd/2545_B_199651	i work in a school system ,
sd/2545_B_199652	and i teach writing
sd/2545_B_199653	and we use the computers a great deal for word processing , you know , because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer , as you probably found out yourself ,
b/2545_A_199654	yeah .
sd/2545_B_199655	but , um , i also am sponsoring a literary magazine ,
sd/2545_B_199656	and we 're doing our entire layout on the computer , uh , because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have ,
b/2545_A_199657	oh , yeah ,
+/2545_B_199658	a publishing program .
ba/2545_A_199659	that 's , that 's neat ,
ba/2545_A_199660	that 's ,
sv/2545_B_199661	so , it is wonderful ,
+/2545_A_199662	a very good use .
sv/2545_B_199663	once you get into some of the programs that are out now , you can do so much with them ,
b/2545_A_199664	yeah .
+/2545_B_199665	that you do n't do until you really make yourself use them .
sd/2545_A_199666	well , i know there , there 's got to be a lot of uses ,
sv/2545_A_199667	but it 's just y , you have ,
sv/2545_B_199668	you have to make yourself do it ,
aa/2545_B_199669	yeah .
+/2545_A_199670	to have a need .
aa/2545_A_199671	yeah ,
sv/2545_A_199672	but you have to have a need .
sd/2545_A_199673	i really have no need for it at all ,
b/2545_B_199674	yeah .
sd/2545_A_199675	um , i work for digital equipment
b/2545_B_199676	uhhuh .
sd/2545_A_199677	and we have a powerful computer down at work .
b/2545_B_199678	oh
bf/2545_B_199679	so , you do n't need a personal one ?
aa/2545_A_199680	no ,
sd/2545_A_199681	and i ,
b/2545_B_199682	yeah .
+/2545_A_199683	i still really do n't do that much , as you say , play games on it ,
b/2545_B_199684	yeah ,
b/2545_B_199685	yeah .
sv/2545_A_199686	they 're great for playing games .
aa/2545_B_199687	right .
%/2545_A_199688	my brother ,
sd/2545_B_199689	well , my son is , uh , studying electronic technology ,
sd/2545_B_199690	and he 's been able to do things on , uh , on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his , um , reports , and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way .
b/2545_A_199691	yeah .
%/2545_B_199692	um , and i guess it ,
sv/2545_B_199693	if you 're doing that sort of thing it 's really useful ,
sv/2545_B_199694	but , um , unless it is , i guess it 's kind of a waste .
%/2545_A_199695	i know some people who just ,
sd/2545_A_199696	they just went through a course , uh , and took the electronic grafting course ,
ba/2545_B_199697	oh , that 's ,
+/2545_A_199698	drafting , not grafting ,
+/2545_B_199699	fascinating .
b/2545_B_199700	uhhuh .
+/2545_A_199701	but drafting course ,
b/2545_B_199702	yeah ,
sd/2545_A_199703	the c a d .
sd/2545_B_199704	i knew what you meant ,
b/2545_B_199705	yeah .
b/2545_A_199706	yeah ,
sv/2545_A_199707	and that 's really neat ,
%/2545_A_199708	i mean , yeah ,
sd/2545_A_199709	you can do graphs , graphs on it too ,
b/2545_B_199710	yeah .
sd/2545_A_199711	but this is , you know , this is one step above it ,
sd/2545_A_199712	but it 's actual , um , drafting ,
b/2545_B_199713	yeah .
%/2545_A_199714	and i always ,
aa/2545_B_199715	yes ,
sv/2545_B_199716	you can do wonderful design .
%/2545_B_199717	it , it 's really , s ,
sv/2545_B_199718	well , especially when anyone who 's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering w , uh , dr , drawing , um ,
sv/2545_B_199719	you have to be so precise .
b/2545_A_199720	yeah ,
sv/2545_A_199721	and the computer does it all for you .
b/2545_B_199722	yeah .
sv/2545_A_199723	so it was really neat .
sd/2545_A_199724	i wanted to go to that course ,
sd/2545_A_199725	but my boss would n't pay for it ,
ba/2545_B_199726	oh , well .
sd/2545_A_199727	i 'm like , i 'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it ,
^q/2545_A_199728	i 'll be needed .
b/2545_B_199729	yeah .
sd/2545_A_199730	because , um , i , i , i did n't want to go do it myself
sd/2545_A_199731	because i did n't think i was really going to use it .
b/2545_B_199732	uhhuh .
sd/2545_A_199733	i got this cough ,
sd/2545_A_199734	i 've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and i went outside with no coat on .
ba/2545_B_199735	oh , boy .
aa/2545_A_199736	yeah ,
sd/2545_A_199737	it was bad .
bh/2545_B_199738	what a change , huh ?
ny/2545_A_199739	yes ,
sd/2545_A_199740	it was a big change .
b/2545_B_199741	yeah .
sd/2545_A_199742	you could n't really wear a coat because it was so hot ,
sd/2545_A_199743	and then , again , i picked up a cold .
b/2545_B_199744	right .
sd/2545_A_199745	but i 'm doing all right , getting over it .
ba/2545_B_199746	well , that 's good .
sd/2545_A_199747	so i do n't , i do n't even know how much , um , personal computers cost nowadays .
sd/2545_B_199748	well , they vary tremendously .
%/2545_B_199749	um , because you can get
%/2545_B_199750	because you 're , they 're , uh ,
sd/2545_B_199751	the ones that were made a few years ago , uh , have come down in price significantly , um ,
sd/2545_B_199752	you can get them , i 've seen them for five , and six hundred dollars ,
sd/2545_B_199753	but they 're much less , um , have much less memory , and capable ,
aa/2545_A_199754	yeah ,
bf/2545_A_199755	they ca n't do your , um ,
+/2545_B_199756	of much less .
+/2545_A_199757	your drafting and your graphs ,
aa/2545_B_199758	no ,
sd/2545_B_199759	you ca n't do very much on them .
+/2545_A_199760	and all of that .
aa/2545_B_199761	right .
aa/2545_B_199762	right .
sd/2545_B_199763	um , well , it 's just that you have to have , uh , you have to be able to get your program in ,
sd/2545_B_199764	and , and ,
x/2545_A_199765	.
+/2545_B_199766	m , many of the programs are so big , uh ,
sd/2545_B_199767	they take up so much space that you do n't have any place then to work .
sd/2545_B_199768	you do n't have any ,
bh/2545_A_199769	yeah ?
+/2545_B_199770	bytes left
sd/2545_B_199771	but , um , if you , um , if , if you want to go into one that 's really useful , you 're going to have to go over a thousand dollars ,
sd/2545_B_199772	and even for a personal computer it 's probably smart to spend that much ,
%/2545_B_199773	an , and we 've ,
sd/2545_B_199774	ours is not quite that powerful ,
sd/2545_B_199775	and so , you know , we are , we are limited ,
qy/2545_A_199776	you do run in ,
+/2545_B_199777	which may be one reason why ,
+/2545_A_199778	you do run into limitations on yours ?
ny/2545_B_199779	oh , yeah ,
ba/2545_A_199780	oh , wow .
b/2545_B_199781	uhhuh ,
sd/2545_B_199782	some things we ca n't do ,
sd/2545_B_199783	but , but then we have n't needed to either ,
b/2545_A_199784	yeah .
+/2545_B_199785	you know , um ,
sd/2545_B_199786	but we 've been able to do what we can .
ba/2545_A_199787	wow , that 's neat that you ev , you even reach the limits of yours .
sd/2545_A_199788	i have n't even begun to reach the limits ,
aa/2545_B_199789	no ,
%/2545_B_199790	but i ,
sd/2545_B_199791	mine is not as good as a p c , uh ,
^2/2545_A_199792	junior ,
b/2545_A_199793	yeah .

b/2545_A_199798	yeah .
sd/2545_B_199799	and it , it 's not quite as , um , as useful , not quite as powerful .
b/2545_A_199800	yeah .
sd/2545_A_199801	they ,
%/2545_B_199802	so ,
+/2545_A_199803	say that commodore has made a good , um , p c for the price , though .
aa/2545_B_199804	they did ,
aa/2545_B_199805	yeah ,
aa/2545_B_199806	that 's very true ,
aa/2545_B_199807	that 's very true ,
aa/2545_B_199808	they did .
aa/2545_A_199809	very competitive .
sd/2545_A_199810	i do n't even , i do n't even know much money my sister spent on hers ,
sd/2545_A_199811	but i , i just thought i , it 's , it 's going to be a waste ,
sd/2545_A_199812	she 's not going to do it ,
x/2545_B_199813	.
+/2545_A_199814	not going to use it .
x/2545_B_199815	.
%/2545_A_199816	oh , well .
bf/2545_B_199817	sounds like he , that you were right .
aa/2545_A_199818	yeah .
sd/2545_A_199819	well , she likes it ,
sd/2545_A_199820	she gets to write her reports ,
sv/2545_A_199821	but like i say ,
b/2545_B_199822	yeah .
+/2545_A_199823	she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wanted .
sv/2545_B_199824	and she could have bought a typewriter also .
aa/2545_A_199825	yeah ,
sv/2545_A_199826	a typewriter with memory would , would have been fine ,
b/2545_B_199827	yeah ,
sd/2545_A_199828	it 's all she ev , uses it for .
b/2545_B_199829	yeah .
sd/2545_A_199830	um , i think it might have a spelling editor on it ,
sd/2545_A_199831	i 'm not sure .
b/2545_B_199832	yeah ,
%/2545_B_199833	it ,
%/2545_B_199834	yeah ,
%/2545_B_199835	it prob ,

b/2545_A_199838	yeah ,
b/2545_B_199839	yeah ,
b/2545_B_199840	right .
sv/2545_A_199841	that 's one of , the one great thing about it .
b/2545_B_199842	right .
qw/2545_B_199843	which program did you use ?
qy/2545_B_199844	did you use word perfect ?
nn/2545_A_199845	um , no ,
%/2545_A_199846	i , i really do n't ,

bk/2545_B_199848	oh , yeah .
sd/2545_A_199849	she pretty much set it up .
sd/2545_A_199850	she goes , here , this is , you make your file , and then you can , uh , edit it .
^g/2545_A_199851	right ?
x/2545_B_199852	.
sd/2545_A_199853	um , i used the one , the one at work a lot , um ,

ny/2528_B_204437	yes .
qw/2528_A_204438	when was that on ?
sd/2528_B_204439	it was usually on , um , thursday nights .
qy/2528_A_204440	on a b c ?
h/2528_B_204441	i do n't know .
b/2528_A_204442	oh , oh , yeah ,
sv/2528_A_204443	well , um , um , it may be that , um , it was recently replaced , by actually by , um , by what may be my favorite t v show of , because sort of , uh , um , twin peaks .
sd/2528_B_204444	it was same time period ,
aa/2528_B_204445	yes .
b/2528_A_204446	yeah ,

sd/2528_A_204453	but anyway they moved it back and forth
sd/2528_A_204454	and that 's when peaks was back in that time slot as well .

x/2528_A_204462	.
qw/2528_B_204463	what 's your second favorite ?
^h/2528_A_204464	um , it 's hard to say
sd/2528_A_204465	i 'm sort of a very big twin peaks fan ,
sd/2528_A_204466	and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on .
sd/2528_A_204467	i 'm , i 'm , half the time i 'm a t v addict
sd/2528_A_204468	and the other half the time i just ignore it

sv/2528_A_204475	and there 's a lot of those blair shows floating around .
qy/2528_B_204476	oh , is he the reformed , um , gambler ?

aa/2528_B_204480	yes .
sd/2528_A_204481	i just like i just finished watching that a few minutes ago , .
%/2528_A_204482	um , and it
sd/2528_A_204483	and , that , that 's a interesting one .
sd/2528_A_204484	i , i , i like that , because there 's , there are ,
sd/2528_A_204485	i 've noticed that every , every major station now has their own law show .
sd/2528_A_204486	there 's l a law ,
sd/2528_A_204487	and there 's , um , equal justice , some other one , law and order or something .
qy/2528_A_204488	do you like the law shows
%/2528_A_204489	or ,
ng/2528_B_204490	i really do n't watch that much t v ,
sd/2528_B_204491	what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch ,
sd/2528_B_204492	and then on the nights i can watch , i 'll pick out something .
ba/2528_A_204493	that , that makes logic ,
%/2528_B_204494	but , um ,
sv/2528_A_204495	also saves a lot of time with commercials .
aa/2528_B_204496	you 're not kidding .
qy/2528_B_204497	do you ever watch american gladiators ?
na/2528_A_204498	oh , i have .
sd/2528_A_204499	i 've , i 've , i watched that late , um ,

fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2528_B_204501	midnight .
sd/2528_A_204502	that 's entering the day as well .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2528_B_204503	midnight .
qy/2528_A_204504	have you , have , have you seen this often ?

ny/2528_B_204507	yeah ,
sd/2528_B_204508	i tape it because i do n't stay up that late to watch it ,
b/2528_A_204509	yeah .
sd/2528_B_204510	i tape it .
sd/2528_B_204511	but i understand , uh , that in england , they play it at normal times because they do n't consider that violent ,
sd/2528_B_204512	and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program .
bh/2528_A_204513	really ?
%/2528_A_204514	i ,
sd/2528_B_204515	and , i 'm like , i do n't believe this .
%/2528_A_204516	that do n't ,
sv/2528_A_204517	it , it , it seems like ,
sv/2528_A_204518	i mean , if wrestling is prime time , professional wrestling , it seems like it 's just , just , just like pros in a wrestling to me ,
sv/2528_A_204519	i do n't , i do n't see any difference though ,
aa/2528_B_204520	i do n't either .
sd/2528_A_204521	i , i do n't understand it ,
sd/2528_A_204522	they consider it violent .
%/2528_A_204523	i have so ever ,
sd/2528_A_204524	i have seen it on , where we are ,
sd/2528_A_204525	i live in , uh , rochester , new york ,
%/2528_A_204526	and i think a ,
qy/2528_B_204527	you 're in new york ?
ny/2528_A_204528	yes .
b/2528_B_204529	oh .
qw/2528_A_204530	where are you ?
sd/2528_B_204531	i 'm in dallas , texas .
%/2528_A_204532	you 're , uh ,
sd/2528_A_204533	everybody i speak to is in texas , oh , oh ,
%/2528_A_204534	yeah ,
sd/2528_A_204535	but i 'm , i 'm in new york
sd/2528_A_204536	and , uh , we seem , we seem to have , um ,
sd/2528_A_204537	i think the american gladiators is on sunday afternoons actually around here as well ,
bh/2528_B_204538	oh , really ?
+/2528_A_204539	sometimes .
sd/2528_A_204540	i think it 's been on ,
sd/2528_A_204541	i think i 've seen it during the day .
b/2528_B_204542	oh .
sd/2528_A_204543	definitely seen it do , on , on , during the day down there ,
sv/2528_A_204544	and i do n't think it 's a very violent show ,
sv/2528_A_204545	i think it 's funny .
sv/2528_A_204546	i think it 's a real good concept ,
sv/2528_A_204547	i think it 's something completely new .
aa/2528_B_204548	i think it 's great .
sd/2528_B_204549	i love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else ,
x/2528_A_204550	.
%/2528_B_204551	and competition .
sd/2528_B_204552	i 'm going oh , great , you know ,
sv/2528_B_204553	it 's a , it 's a great role model for everybody .
aa/2528_A_204554	i think so ,
sv/2528_A_204555	i think because people sort of get through , you know , um , i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the , as well as , you know , some mental fitness
sv/2528_A_204556	and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth .
aa/2528_B_204557	oh , yes ,
sd/2528_B_204558	i mean , when i had , uh ,
sd/2528_B_204559	i was watching it , the , first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well , it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities .
sd/2528_B_204560	and , uh , there she was terrific ,
sd/2528_B_204561	she was really terrific .
qy^d/2528_A_204562	well , do n't they take people who have some sort of , um , big abilities like
sd/2528_A_204563	and , and at least they used to when it , when it ,
sd/2528_A_204564	the first ones i saw they had , um , a man on who was , uh , he played college football and almost went pro ,
sd/2528_A_204565	and they had a , a woman who was a black belt in karate
sd/2528_A_204566	and she was the , uh , she was in the junior olympics or something
sd/2528_A_204567	or they seem to have people who have very , very big sports backgrounds .
%/2528_A_204568	to have
sd/2528_A_204569	they , le , leaned away from that sort of ,
sd/2528_B_204570	they hold competitions in los angeles in , um , florida and minneapolis , minnea , um ,
h/2528_B_204571	trying to think of ,
sv/2528_B_204572	i think it 's in four places around the united states .
sd/2528_B_204573	they hold competition
sd/2528_B_204574	and the only requirement is , of course , your skill of passing these tests ,
qy^d/2528_A_204575	oh , that 's how they do it .
na/2528_B_204576	and that 's it .
sd/2528_B_204577	and we had a bar man from here in dallas area that made it .
bh/2528_A_204578	really ?
sd/2528_B_204579	there is a woman that , uh , made ,
sd/2528_B_204580	well , she called herself a craft person
sd/2528_B_204581	so , i 'm not quite sure what she made .
x/2528_A_204582	.
sd/2528_B_204583	and , uh , she made it .
%/2528_B_204584	i mean there is no ,
sv/2528_B_204585	your occupation has nothing to do with it .
b/2528_A_204586	yeah ,
b/2528_A_204587	okay ,
sv/2528_A_204588	i just thought they had some ,

b/2528_A_204590	yeah ,
sv/2528_A_204591	i thought they had some sort of ,
sd/2528_A_204592	i mean , i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not ,
ba/2528_A_204593	that 's great .
b/2528_B_204594	huhuh .
oo_co_cc/2528_A_204595	but , maybe i 'll try it one day .

b/2528_A_204617	yeah ,
sv/2528_A_204618	they seem like a tennis ball
sv/2528_A_204619	but it almost does n't look like it 's almost livable
%/2528_A_204620	yeah ,
%/2528_A_204621	the best
sd/2528_A_204622	i , i do n't think i could , i , i could handle those tennis balls .

sv/2528_A_204636	but , i 'm sure that 's fun .
sd/2528_B_204637	um , most of the lawyer programs like , uh , law and order ,

sv/2528_A_204661	i think they put things on at , um , eleven o'clock here
sd/2528_A_204662	and i think they put it like eleven o'clock , um , california time , like in california
sd/2528_A_204663	but in the middle they sort of , um ,
sd/2528_A_204664	like central time or mountain time they , they push things back .
%/2528_A_204665	so , i was actually , actually
h/2528_A_204666	i 'm not sure
sd/2528_A_204667	, i was in , i was in iowa awhile ago , and noticed that everything was an hour earlier ,
qy/2528_A_204668	so , does your prime time start at seven o'clock ?
nn/2528_B_204669	no ,
sd/2528_B_204670	well , they have it at six

ad/2528_A_204672	wait ,
nn/2528_A_204673	no ,
nn/2528_A_204674	no ,
sd/2528_B_204675	and they have one at ten .
sd/2528_A_204676	not , not even the news

qy/2528_A_204678	do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth , start at seven o'clock ?
%/2528_A_204679	you ,
qy/2528_A_204680	so , like , you know , the regular television shows that are , that are very popular , do they start at ,
h/2528_B_204681	i 'm trying to think .
+/2528_A_204682	seven or , or at eight ?
na/2528_B_204683	both ,
^h/2528_B_204684	um , let 's see they start , um ,
sd/2528_B_204685	evening shade at seven
sd/2528_B_204686	and then it goes to , um ,
t1/2528_B_204687	what is it after evening , um ,
b/2528_A_204688	right ,
sd/2528_A_204689	because that would the eight o'clock here .
sd/2528_B_204690	that 's major dad at eight i think it is .
b/2528_A_204691	yeah ,
sd/2528_A_204692	that , that would all start at , at , um , that would all start at , at eight o'clock here ,
sd/2528_A_204693	that would n't start at seven .
%/2528_A_204694	we have , um ,
sd/2528_A_204695	at seven o'clock we just have , um ,
%/2528_A_204696	the ,
sd/2528_A_204697	they 'll play , you know , they have old reruns of cheers or something from seven to seven thirty , and then something else from seven thirty to eight
b/2528_B_204698	huh .
sd/2528_A_204699	and ours start at , at , at , at eight and end at eleven ,
%/2528_A_204700	that 's why we
sv/2528_A_204701	. i , i would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten .
b/2528_B_204702	yeah ,
sd/2528_B_204703	it 's , it 's stopped around here at ten
sd/2528_B_204704	and it goes into night programs , at that point which could be one of , you know , many different night programs
sd/2528_B_204705	but it goes into night programs .
ba/2528_A_204706	oh , that 's great .
qy/2528_B_204707	but , uh , do you ever watch cheers ?
na/2528_A_204708	oh , all the time .
x/2528_B_204709	.
qy/2528_A_204710	do you watch cheers
ny/2528_B_204711	oh , yeah ,
ny/2528_B_204712	oh , yeah .
%/2528_A_204713	it 's at ,
sd/2528_A_204714	that was actually a big dilemma for me now because , um , cheers , cheers and twin peaks are now on the same time ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2289_A_210983	okay ,
ad/2289_A_210984	we , we can , uh , be recorded while we talk about it .
aa/2289_B_210985	okay ,
qy/2289_B_210986	well is your ,
qy/2289_B_210987	does your city have mandatory , uh , recycling ?
nn/2289_A_210988	no ,
sd/2289_A_210989	we do n't have mandatory .
sv/2289_A_210990	we , actually , we 're kind of slow up here ,
sd/2289_A_210991	and we 've just started doing recycling probably last summer .
sd/2289_A_210992	and it 's all voluntary .
sd/2289_A_210993	so that 's interesting .
qy/2289_A_210994	cities have a mandatory recycling ?
na/2289_B_210995	um , there , there 're some places that are strongly encouraging it ,
sd/2289_B_210996	and that they city will pick it up .
sd/2289_B_210997	that 's been one of the arguments here .
sd/2289_B_210998	i 'm just sitting here looking . we 've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff .
sd/2289_B_210999	but we have to carry it , uh , some distance ,
sd/2289_B_211000	and some places , um , you can sell your , uh , recyclables ,
sd/2289_B_211001	and , for example , our church was collecting newspapers .
b/2289_A_211002	yeah ,
sd/2289_A_211003	when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing .
sd/2289_A_211004	we got like a penny a pound for them .
sd/2289_B_211005	well , it turns out that so much ,
sd/2289_B_211006	the problem in texas is that , uh , they 've got so much paper now from people recycling that they 've got no way to , uh , reprocess it .
ba/2289_A_211007	oh , my ,
sd/2289_B_211008	it requires an ex , it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it ,
sd/2289_B_211009	and so the value has gone down .
sd/2289_B_211010	it turns out it was n't worth for the church to do .
ba/2289_A_211011	oh , i did n't realize ,
sv/2289_A_211012	you would think ,
sv/2289_A_211013	now up here , i , i suppose they send it all back to the mill
sd/2289_A_211014	and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of , uh .
sd/2289_A_211015	actually there is one in northern vermont .
sd/2289_A_211016	so there 's probably a paper mill that 's sixty miles from here .
sd/2289_A_211017	i did n't think that ,
sv/2289_A_211018	you know , in the large city that if the next recycling , if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away
%/2289_B_211019	well ,
+/2289_A_211020	it 's a lot of money to transport .
b/2289_B_211021	yeah ,
%/2289_B_211022	well see , that 's ,
sd/2289_B_211023	in , in dallas there no plan to build ,
sd/2289_B_211024	i think there , there 's some in east texas there 's some pulp mills ,
sd/2289_B_211025	but , uh , you have to go to houston ,
sd/2289_B_211026	and , it 's interesting ,
sd/2289_B_211027	and then there 's places that will buy metal
sd/2289_B_211028	and they still buy aluminum can and likes that . *can cans ? likes like ?
qh/2289_A_211029	do you have to buy metal ,
sv/2289_A_211030	like copper is a very good one to collect .
sv/2289_A_211031	even aluminum ,
%/2289_A_211032	yeah ,
%/2289_A_211033	so .
qy/2289_B_211034	well , do you do , do you do recycling ?
na/2289_A_211035	uh , we do the recycling ,
sd/2289_A_211036	and our city will pick up our recyclables .
b/2289_B_211037	oh .
sd/2289_A_211038	they have these little blue bins .
sd/2289_A_211039	um , i do n't recycle personally .
sd/2289_A_211040	i , i 'm saying i want to do it ,
sd/2289_A_211041	but , i do n't get a lot of magazines ,
sd/2289_A_211042	i do n't get a ,
sd/2289_A_211043	i do n't buy the newspaper ,
sd/2289_A_211044	but i do have a lot of , uh ,
sd/2289_A_211045	my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart , a lot of different papers and cardboards .
qy/2289_B_211046	well , do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans ?
ny/2289_A_211047	yes ,
sd/2289_A_211048	but we have a bottle return .
sd/2289_A_211049	a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles .
sd/2289_A_211050	we 've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years .
bf/2289_B_211051	oh , so it 's worth taking them back .
sd/2289_B_211052	well , see , we do n't have .
sd/2289_B_211053	we have , we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles .
sv/2289_A_211054	oh , they should definitely get , um , the nickel returnable .
sv/2289_A_211055	it 's great for the kids , because
sd/2289_A_211056	see , a lot of the kids get the money from it ,
sv/2289_A_211057	and it 's great for the boy scouts running around , they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes .
sd/2289_B_211058	oh , that 's it ,
%/2289_B_211059	you 'll , you 'll ,
sd/2289_B_211060	there is a down side to all this , you know , about no good deed going unpunished ,
+/2289_B_211061	that , uh , my mother sells , um , trees that they make paper out of ,
sd/2289_B_211062	and so every time i recycle newspapers , in fact there 's a , there 's a , uh ,
sd/2289_B_211063	kimberly and clark , the makers of kleenex and such
b/2289_A_211064	yeah .
+/2289_B_211065	has a , uh , a big paper mill .
sd/2289_B_211066	in fact i almost went to work for them .
sd/2289_B_211067	i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me .
sd/2289_B_211068	it 's twenty or thirty miles from my house .
sd/2289_B_211069	every time you recycle , that 's one less tree my mother can sell ,
sd/2289_B_211070	and , uh . so , it 's a question should i be diligent and , um ,
^2/2289_A_211071	and recycle .
+/2289_B_211072	and , and recycle , and put my mother out of her livelihood .
b/2289_A_211073	oh , yes ,
ba/2289_A_211074	i see that .
sd/2289_B_211075	but , it 's an interesting point , though , that , you know , everybody 's so anxious to recycle ,
sv/2289_B_211076	and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment ,
%/2289_B_211077	but ,
^2/2289_A_211078	but it takes away employment from the resource
%/2289_A_211079	and its .
sv/2289_B_211080	well , but in general i think it 's a good idea because
aa/2289_A_211081	i do , too .
+/2289_B_211082	like the glass , you ca n't argue that the glass ,
sd/2289_B_211083	it does n't biodegrade , and , and , uh , the plastics obviously ,
sd/2289_A_211084	they do n't either
sv/2289_B_211085	so we might as well recycle those .
b/2289_A_211086	yeah ,
sv/2289_A_211087	like i say , it 's not a very controversial thing .
sv/2289_A_211088	everyone thinks we should do it .
sv/2289_A_211089	it 's just that we 're so lazy ,
sd/2289_A_211090	i mean , like personally , i do n't want to clean my ,
sd/2289_A_211091	i just have can cat food .
sd/2289_A_211092	i do n't want to clean the can and take the label off it , and put it in a separate bin .
b/2289_B_211093	yeah .
sd/2289_A_211094	you know , i 'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash .
sd/2289_B_211095	well , that 's what we 've got .
sd/2289_B_211096	we started about , new year 's we decided we 'd get ambitious .
sd/2289_B_211097	well , we took one load over there ,
sd/2289_B_211098	and now we 've got these containers filling up with stuff ,
sd/2289_B_211099	and , you know , it 's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there .
b/2289_A_211100	yeah ,
sd/2289_A_211101	i think i would be like ,
sd/2289_A_211102	when i bring my bottles back . if they 're pretty clean and stuff , so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months ,
sd/2289_A_211103	and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov , and bring them over .
sd/2289_A_211104	now , if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean , like if i washed all the cans and things , i would n't mind if it sat around too much ,
sd/2289_A_211105	but if , if it stunk or something i would n't like doing it .
sd/2289_A_211106	but , um , i produce quite a bit of trash ,
sd/2289_A_211107	my , you know , house ,
sd/2289_A_211108	and i see it ,
sd/2289_A_211109	but i do n't see so much that i can recycle .
b/2289_B_211110	yeah .
sd/2289_A_211111	like i say , it 's a lot of different type paper and cardboard .
sd/2289_A_211112	i 'm not a real plastic person user , but a lot of paper , um , pretty much ,
sd/2289_A_211113	and i do n't know how they sort that .
sd/2289_A_211114	but if , if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles , i would think that i wou , i would have a recycling center .
sd/2289_A_211115	but now , it 's just me and my husband ,
h/2289_A_211116	so , i do n't know .
sv/2289_B_211117	but every little bit helps ,
^q/2289_B_211118	right .
ny/2289_A_211119	yeah ,
sd/2289_A_211120	i know what you 're saying .
sd/2289_A_211121	but we have , we have a very aggressive recycling at work ,
sd/2289_A_211122	and i 'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin .
sv/2289_A_211123	see , some people , it 's , the recycle bin is on their way out .
sv/2289_A_211124	instead of carrying your newspapers , when they get done with them at the end of the day , they throw them in the trash .
qy/2289_B_211125	well , do you have separate trash cans at your desk .
nn/2289_A_211126	um , no ,
sd/2289_A_211127	we do n't ,
sd/2289_A_211128	but other , other offices do .
sd/2289_A_211129	they have a box for papers .
sd/2289_B_211130	well , we have , we have one that 's recyclable and , and then for uh , lunch sacks and waste food
sd/2289_B_211131	and they gave us a list of things that are n't re ,
sd/2289_B_211132	and it turns out it 's not so bad .
sd/2289_B_211133	i , i get a lot of reports that , that are covered in plastic or plas , like saran wrap or something , anyway ,
sd/2289_B_211134	and then , uh , cardboard , there 's a few ,
sd/2289_B_211135	it 's interesting that we 're , we 're recycling computer type paper .
b/2289_A_211136	yeah .
sd/2289_B_211137	and , and , uh , one day they 'll pick up , uh ,
sd/2289_B_211138	the cleaning people come through and they 'll pick up recycled paper ,
sd/2289_B_211139	and then the next day they 'll pick up the other ,
%/2289_B_211140	so .
b/2289_A_211141	oh .
sd/2289_B_211142	depending on how much ,
sd/2289_B_211143	you know , and there 's a lot of , actually , it works pretty well ,
sd/2289_B_211144	and then we have a , uh , waste , uh , cans for aluminum in the , in the break areas at work .
sd/2289_A_211145	well , that 's , that 's a really good idea , because , um , like our , uh , fruit juices for some reason when they 're in a can do n't come with a deposit .
b/2289_B_211146	yeah .
sv/2289_A_211147	and they 're thinking about putting a deposit on them , because pretty much you have to , you 're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans , where they 're
b/2289_B_211148	yeah ,
+/2289_A_211149	so much easier just to put a deposit on it , because most , probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits , because they 're beer and soda ,
sd/2289_A_211150	but when they sell juice , it 's some strange quirk in the law , you do n't have to have a deposit on it .
sd/2289_A_211151	and even like , the , a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it ,
sd/2289_A_211152	but if it 's got soda in it , it does .
sd/2289_A_211153	so , it 's a strange .
sd/2289_B_211154	that 's an interesting distinction .
b/2289_A_211155	yeah ,
sv/2289_A_211156	they should , they should clean , clear that up .
sd/2289_A_211157	it would n't take them much to put a stamp on the , uh , juice cans as easily as the soda .
b/2289_B_211158	yeah .
sd/2289_A_211159	so , but redemption centers are a big thing up here ,
sd/2289_A_211160	they get a penny a can they handle .
sd/2289_A_211161	they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor .
sv/2289_A_211162	i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can .
sd/2289_B_211163	well , see , well , see , those of us that do n't have state income taxes ,
sd/2289_B_211164	yet
b/2289_A_211165	yeah .
+/2289_B_211166	that 's the big debate here in texas , that the legislature wants to put one in ,
sd/2289_B_211167	and , it 's interesting what people get upset about ,
sd/2289_B_211168	uh , it really is .
qy/2289_A_211169	is bot , is bottle return down there a heated debate ?
nn/2289_B_211170	well , no ,
bk/2289_A_211171	oh , yeah .
sd/2289_A_211172	well , we ,
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2289_A_211173	well , here you ca n't drink ,
sd/2289_B_211174	we 're not civilized now , you can no longer , you can not drink beer and drive ,
sd/2289_B_211175	but
%/2289_A_211176	well .
+/2289_B_211177	but it was , it was actually legal .
b/2289_A_211178	yes ,
sd/2289_A_211179	well , i know , i was in atlanta ,
sd/2289_A_211180	and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand .
sd/2289_A_211181	but here , let me put that in a paper cup for you .
sd/2289_A_211182	so that was strange .
sv/2289_A_211183	but , i think ,
sv/2289_A_211184	if some people they have ,
sv/2289_A_211185	they say , well , we 're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these , um , the , the recycle center , you have to deal with the can and then you have to , to recycle it ,
sv/2289_A_211186	and , their problem 's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits
b/2289_B_211187	yeah .
+/2289_A_211188	see how they handle it ,
sd/2289_A_211189	and see if it 's a good way ,
sd/2289_A_211190	and then do it that way . because , as , like i say , people are making money on it .
sv/2289_B_211191	well , you know , the other ,
sd/2289_A_211192	the cans do , are worth something .
+/2289_B_211193	well the other thing is , it also is , is a , is a , a good habit , uh , to , uh , just to conserve resources , you know , where they , you know , because you get in the habit of that , you think in terms of , of , uh , of , of things like saving
