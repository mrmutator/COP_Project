fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2121_A_196258	okay uh
qw/2121_A_196259	could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution ?
^h/2121_B_196260	well it 's hard to say .
sv/2121_B_196261	i mean while it 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot uh if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it 's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all .
qo/2121_B_196262	what do you think ?
sd/2121_A_196263	um well you talked about uh volcanos .
sd/2121_A_196264	i 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere .
sv/2121_A_196265	i think probably the greatest cause is uh vehicles especially around cities .
b/2121_B_196266	uhhuh .
qy/2121_A_196267	um uh do you live right in the city itself ?
nn/2121_B_196268	no
sd/2121_B_196269	i 'm more out in the suburbs
sd/2121_B_196270	but i certainly work near a city .
bk/2121_A_196271	okay
qy/2121_A_196272	so ca can you notice
qo/2121_B_196273	how about you ?
%/2121_A_196274	well it 's it 's
sd/2121_A_196275	i live in a rural area .
b/2121_B_196276	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196277	it 's mainly farms and uh no heavy industry .
sd/2121_A_196278	attleboro itself
sd/2121_A_196279	i live in rhode island .
b/2121_B_196280	oh i see .
sd/2121_A_196281	and it 's in the north
sd/2121_A_196282	i live up in the uh northeast corner
sd/2121_A_196283	and attleboro sits in just over the line where t i 's plant is
b/2121_B_196284	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196285	but there is n't a lot of heavy industry .
sd/2121_A_196286	there 's the freeways
sd/2121_A_196287	and we get an occasional
sd/2121_A_196288	it depends which way the wind 's blowing from boston cause we 're like forty miles south of boston
sd/2121_A_196289	so we 'll pick up that .
sd/2121_A_196290	and uh i 've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years uh
sd/2121_A_196291	we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
sd/2121_A_196292	and i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger
sd/2121_A_196293	they 're swinging wider so that now they are coming over over our homes .
b/2121_B_196294	uhhuh .
sv/2121_A_196295	and it seems like uh we 're catching all that residue .
sd/2121_A_196296	i 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that 's dropping .
sd/2121_A_196297	but other than that you know we do n't have the unless we 're catching it from the midwest the emissions . you know from the power plants . um .
b/2121_B_196298	yeah .
bf/2121_B_196299	you mean like from the coal .
ny/2121_A_196300	yeah
ny/2121_A_196301	yeah
sd/2121_A_196302	we generate
sd/2121_A_196303	one of our our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to uh generate electricity .
%/2121_B_196304	um
sv/2121_A_196305	um there does n't seem to be much emission from them
sd/2121_A_196306	but i 'm not sure about the rest of the country .
b/2121_B_196307	yeah
sv/2121_B_196308	i notice locally a major problem is kodak .
sv/2121_B_196309	um it 's interesting
sd/2121_B_196310	because in order to uh keep with the e p a standards which which tend to be visible uh what 's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night .
sd/2121_B_196311	uh so people get up
b/2121_A_196312	okay
bh/2121_A_196313	well is that right ? .
ny/2121_B_196314	yeah
sd/2121_B_196315	people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
sd/2121_B_196316	and they 've got this black ash on their cars which you know seems to be
x/2121_A_196317	.
b/2121_A_196318	yeah
ba/2121_A_196319	surprise surprise .
b/2121_B_196320	yeah
sv/2121_B_196321	i mean i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh you know
b/2121_A_196322	yeah .
sv/2121_A_196323	there there must be uh uh some of the some of the uh larger plants up uh up around one hundred twentyeight .
b/2121_B_196324	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196325	um we 've got reports that uh
sd/2121_A_196326	during the night seems like they 'd blow off their their stacks from uh the warehouses for powerhouses
b/2121_B_196327	right .
b/2121_B_196328	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196329	and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them .
b/2121_B_196330	right .
b/2121_B_196331	yeah
b/2121_B_196332	yeah .
sd/2121_A_196333	so you 're right
sv/2121_A_196334	they could do something a. about about that i guess .
aa/2121_B_196335	yeah .
sv/2121_B_196336	that seems a little ridiculous .
qo/2121_A_196337	how are your uh your lakes
%/2121_A_196338	and uh
sd/2121_B_196339	oh they 've been getting cleaner .
qy^d/2121_A_196340	they have ?
na/2121_B_196341	sure .
%/2121_B_196342	but um yeah
sd/2121_B_196343	i 'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain
%/2121_B_196344	yeah
b^m/2121_A_196345	acid rain
b/2121_A_196346	yeah
sd/2121_A_196347	that 's that 's what i was uh
sd/2121_B_196348	i mean the stuff i 've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit uh overstated . that a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all .
%/2121_B_196349	um ye
h/2121_B_196350	i 'm not an expert .
aa/2121_A_196351	yeah
aa/2121_A_196352	no .
qy/2121_A_196353	did n't they just have an article oh on uh
sd/2121_A_196354	they were dumping lime .
b/2121_B_196355	up here ?
sd/2121_A_196356	up upstate new york somewhere over huge areas
sd/2121_B_196357	i have n't read that .
b/2121_B_196358	oh yeah .
sd/2121_A_196359	and they thought that was more beneficial because you know it it some of it does soak in
sd/2121_A_196360	and some of it runs off right away into the in to the streams and rivers
sd/2121_A_196361	and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback .
b/2121_B_196362	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196363	i ca n't remember where
sd/2121_A_196364	i i read that recently somewhere
sd/2121_A_196365	and i ca n't remember where .
b/2121_B_196366	yeah
ba/2121_B_196367	that 's interesti
sv/2121_A_196368	but i i thought it was up there .
sv/2121_A_196369	so that 's interesting because new hampshire and parts of vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain .
b/2121_B_196370	uhhuh .
%/2121_B_196371	um .
qy/2121_A_196372	um you kind of think it 's something else then ?
arp_nd/2121_B_196373	well that 's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article .
%/2121_B_196374	so that
bf/2121_A_196375	oh they did n't say they did n't say what though
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2121_A_196376	they just said they thought it was
na/2121_B_196377	they did n't say what
sd/2121_B_196378	they just said they thought acid rain 's contribution may be less than was previously suspected . um that it may be other natural things at work . um
bf/2121_A_196379	uh natural disease
aa/2121_B_196380	yeah
sv/2121_B_196381	so it 's it 's less than clear .
sd/2121_B_196382	like i said i do n't remember the article that well .
b/2121_A_196383	yeah
b/2121_A_196384	yeah .
h/2121_B_196385	but um i do n't know
qw/2121_B_196386	i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution ? .
sv/2121_A_196387	uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing .
sv/2121_A_196388	i still think that 's that 's uh one of our major causes of pollutants .
b/2121_B_196389	uhhuh .
sv/2121_A_196390	uh how we go about that it 's uh uh it 's a little bit difficult .
sv/2121_B_196391	i think it 's up to individuals too to ask automakers for for less pollutant vehicles .
b/2121_A_196392	yeah
b/2121_A_196393	yeah
sv/2121_A_196394	you ne yo ne i think you need a a vehicle something like uh ralph nader nader 's raiders or where uh or uh uh a a r p which has a lot of members . uh if you can get those types of groups .
b/2121_B_196395	yeah .
b/2121_B_196396	uhhuh .
qy/2121_B_196397	do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem .
sd/2121_B_196398	i mean i remember reading an article that said like it 's uh the older polluters
sd/2121_B_196399	the the twelve and fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution
b/2121_A_196400	yeah
sv/2121_B_196401	and the new cars it 's hardly is hardly anything .
aa/2121_A_196402	yeah
sv/2121_A_196403	they 're better
qh/2121_A_196404	but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there .
qw/2121_A_196405	uh when was the last time you saw a truck that did n't belch smoke or uh
b/2121_B_196406	yeah
qy/2121_B_196407	but does n't that just mean they 're out of tune .
no/2121_A_196408	uh i 'm not really sure .
qy^d/2121_A_196409	you think that that that the uh the trucking indus industry is that uh incompetent that they would n't you know
sd/2121_A_196410	fuel is is one of their biggest costs .
b/2121_B_196411	right .
%/2121_A_196412	so you would
%/2121_B_196413	but diesel engines .
b/2121_A_196414	yeah
sd/2121_A_196415	diesel engines .
%/2121_B_196416	it you know it 's it
sv/2121_B_196417	i mean they do generate a lot of soot
sv/2121_B_196418	but that at least that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly .
b/2121_A_196419	yeah .
b/2121_A_196420	yeah .
sd/2121_A_196421	we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems .
sv/2121_A_196422	this country seems to be a little behind on that .
b/2121_B_196423	yeah .
sv/2121_B_196424	on the other hand most people do n't use rapid transit because it 's so inconvenient .
b/2121_A_196425	um yeah
sv/2121_A_196426	but only because we got used to uh single person single car driving .
b/2121_B_196427	uhhuh .
sv/2121_A_196428	a lot of people do n't even like to carpool .
b/2121_B_196429	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196430	but we could that .
sv/2121_A_196431	that 'll help pollution air pollution
b/2121_B_196432	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196433	the uh united states and canada are i guess is is going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what 's being given out by power plants
b/2121_B_196434	uhhuh .
sd/2121_A_196435	i guess canada 's quite concerned that we 're sending a lot of our stuff up there
b/2121_B_196436	yeah
b/2121_B_196437	sure .
sv/2121_A_196438	so that 's helping .
qw/2121_B_196439	well what do you think about like a device a meter right on a tail pipe
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2121_B_196440	and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted ?
ba/2121_A_196441	now that 's an idea .
ad/2121_A_196442	do n't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue
sd/2121_B_196443	well it just means if you do n't pollute right or you pollute very little you do n't have to pay any tax
sd/2121_B_196444	or you just buy one of these things
%/2121_B_196445	and it it uh
sv/2121_B_196446	maybe you you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
sd/2121_B_196447	and uh the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
sd/2121_B_196448	and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
sd/2121_B_196449	and you could n't start your car anymore .
ba/2121_A_196450	that 's a that 's an interesting concept .
qy/2121_A_196451	is that your idea ?
ny/2121_B_196452	yeah
%/2121_B_196453	but uh you know it 's uh
sv/2121_B_196454	i guess the difficulty would be to that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
sv/2121_B_196455	so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something .
sd/2121_A_196456	well i was going to say
aa/2121_A_196457	right .
sd/2121_A_196458	you could put it in you could you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter .
b/2121_B_196459	right .
sv/2121_A_196460	i mean i guess you could take those off too
%/2121_A_196461	but
%/2121_B_196462	you could take ca
sv/2121_B_196463	but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off .
aa/2121_A_196464	yeah
sd/2121_A_196465	if you can take a muffler off and only replace
sd/2121_A_196466	well not unless it was built into every muffler .
b/2121_B_196467	right .
%/2121_A_196468	and that 's .
sd/2121_B_196469	but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that uh busses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax uh this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
ba/2121_A_196471	that 's a that 's quite a concept .
sv/2121_A_196472	you should uh pursue that i think or patent it you know .
aa/2121_B_196473	yeah
sd/2121_B_196474	patent it
sv/2121_B_196475	that 's a good idea .
sv/2121_A_196476	if you could come up with a device that 's the thing .
b/2121_B_196477	right .
sv/2121_A_196478	but it should n't be too hard to do something like that .
sd/2121_A_196479	but that 's a that 's a thought .
%/2121_A_196480	no
b/2121_B_196481	uhhuh .
sv/2121_A_196482	you 're right
sv/2121_A_196483	and that will solve uh a lot of problems .
sv/2121_A_196484	i do n't know if you uh if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that .
b/2121_B_196485	uhhuh .
sv/2121_A_196486	uh but you know a proposal to uh uh i guess the proper authorities
b/2121_B_196487	uhhuh .
sv/2121_A_196488	well you might uh generate some
b/2121_B_196489	yeah
bf/2121_B_196490	the automobile regulatory agencies or something .
ny/2121_A_196491	yeah
sv/2121_A_196492	you might generate some interest in it .
sv/2121_A_196493	but that 's that 's a good idea .
sv/2121_A_196494	other than that i 'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization .
b/2121_B_196495	uhhuh .
qw/2131_B_196496	what are your m music interests ?
sd/2131_A_196497	uh just about any kind of music except acid rock
x/2131_B_196498	.
sd/2131_A_196499	i i do n't care for acid rock
aa/2131_B_196500	me too .
b/2131_B_196501	oh .
sd/2131_A_196502	but uh i grew up with country and western

sd/2131_B_196504	i did too
%/2131_A_196505	but uh

sd/2131_B_196510	uh i 'm pretty diversified too .
sd/2131_B_196511	i i do n't i do n't like acid rock either .
sd/2131_B_196512	i i grew up in a small town
sd/2131_B_196513	so uh the only we only had one radio station
sd/2131_B_196514	so it was country music
b/2131_A_196515	yeah .

sv/2131_B_196767	you you 'd well you 'd think there would be .
sv/2131_A_196768	well the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle

sv/2131_B_196779	i 'm i 'm sure you could find old players for them
sv/2131_B_196780	but that would cost a fortune if you could find them that worked .

b/2131_A_196782	yeah .
b/2131_B_196783	oh .

aa/2131_B_196785	no .
b/2131_B_196786	uhhuh .
qy/2131_B_196787	well those things were big and thick were n't they ?
ny/2131_A_196788	yeah
ny/2131_A_196789	yeah .
sv/2131_B_196790	you could kill somebody with them .
b/2131_A_196791	yeah
%/2131_A_196792	th
sd/2131_A_196793	warped real easy .
sv/2131_B_196794	and the ones you buy
ad/2131_B_196795	go out and buy one now
sv/2131_B_196796	and they 're just so thin and flimsy
b/2131_A_196797	yeah .
sv/2131_B_196798	and they just they 're not meant to last at all
b/2131_A_196799	yeah .

sd/2131_B_196801	i i bu we buy cassette tapes
b/2131_A_196802	yeah .
sd/2131_B_196803	and machines will eat them
b/2131_A_196804	yeah .
sv/2131_B_196805	and so the best bet any anymo these days are compact disk
sv/2131_B_196806	those things are practically indestructible .
sd/2131_A_196807	but i i guess you know the old country and western music you
sd/2131_A_196808	back then when i was a kid there was n't that much t v
b/2131_B_196809	oh no .
sd/2131_A_196810	so that 's all you had to listen to was the radio
^2/2131_B_196811	radio .

%/2131_B_196815	plus
b/2131_A_196816	yeah .
sv/2131_B_196817	i think it was better back then to
sv/2131_B_196818	th there 's too much t v now
b/2131_A_196819	yeah .
sv/2131_B_196820	and the radio is you know more exciting really than than television
b/2131_A_196821	yeah .
%/2131_B_196822	kep
%/2131_B_196823	your imagination
b/2131_A_196824	yeah .
%/2131_B_196825	i i kept
%/2131_B_196826	and yo
sv/2131_B_196827	it just did n't vegetate your mind like television does .
b/2131_A_196828	yeah
sd/2131_A_196829	i remember mother and dad always turned on the grand ole opera .
b/2131_B_196830	oh yeah .
b^m/2131_A_196831	yeah .
qy/2131_B_196832	was it on the radio every week ?
ny/2131_A_196833	yeah .
qw/2131_B_196834	wha what day what day was that on
qy/2131_B_196835	do you ha can you recall .
sv/2131_A_196836	uh uh seems like it was on a friday
%/2131_B_196837	uh .
%/2131_A_196838	friday or
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2151_B_196839	okay .
b^m/2151_A_196840	okay .
qw/2151_B_196841	well what do you think about the idea of uh kids having to do public service work for a year ?
qy/2151_B_196842	do you think it 's a
sv/2151_A_196843	well i i think it 's a pretty good idea .
sv/2151_A_196844	i think they should either do that or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people .
aa/2151_B_196845	yes
aa/2151_B_196846	yes
%/2151_B_196847	def
sv/2151_A_196848	i i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
sv/2151_A_196849	and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
sv/2151_A_196850	and i 'm not sure that that 's not a bad idea
aa/2151_B_196851	that 's true .
sv/2151_A_196852	and or the military for a year or two would n't be bad for
b/2151_B_196853	yeah .
sv/2151_A_196854	i think it teaches kids how to grow .
qo/2151_A_196855	how about yourself ?
aa/2151_B_196856	uh i agree with you .
sd/2151_B_196857	uh uh what i 'm thinking about is back well when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of i i
sv/2151_B_196858	you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the boy scouts or girl scouts
sv/2151_B_196859	and they did do do do a lot of public service activities
sv/2151_B_196860	but these days they 're not uh
sv/2151_B_196861	par parents are n't encouraging their kids to do things like that .
sd/2151_B_196862	because when i was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that 's just part o of of the scouting and you know .
b/2151_A_196863	yeah
%/2151_A_196864	i 've i 've
sv/2151_A_196865	that 's really great .
sv/2151_A_196866	i i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations .
aa/2151_B_196867	they are
%/2151_B_196868	but parents
sv/2151_A_196869	you know kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that
aa/2151_B_196870	yeah
aa/2151_B_196871	they do .
sv/2151_A_196872	and they do n't follow it at all you know .
sv/2151_A_196873	there are very few scouts go on and become eagle scouts .
aa/2151_B_196874	oh no .
sd/2151_A_196875	and and i do n't know what the high rank is for the gals
%/2151_A_196876	but
%/2151_B_196877	i i uh
sd/2151_B_196878	senior .
b/2151_A_196879	oh .

sd/2229_B_196972	i had an i had an exercise bike
sd/2229_A_196973	i used to jog somewhat .
sd/2229_B_196974	i use to have one
sd/2229_B_196975	and i finally got rid of sit cause i never used it

%/2229_A_196981	it 's
sd/2229_A_196982	when i go visit them uh i get on that thing every now and then .
b/2229_B_196983	yeah
sv/2229_B_196984	it 's nice because when the weather 's bad you ca n't you do n't have any excuse .
b/2229_A_196985	uhhuh
sd/2229_A_196986	i just got the bicycle out today
sd/2229_A_196987	and it was real nice outside
sd/2229_A_196988	had to get out to do something .
b/2229_B_196989	yeah
sd/2229_B_196990	i ca n't ride a bike
%/2229_B_196991	so .
sd/2229_A_196992	i 've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
sd/2229_A_196993	so thought i better better get outside and do something and not waist the day .
b/2229_B_196994	oh .
b/2229_B_196995	yeah
sv/2229_B_196996	it 's too nice
sv/2229_B_196997	it 's been too nice all weekend .
b/2229_A_196998	but uh yeah
sv/2229_A_196999	i need to start jog something again .
sv/2229_A_197000	i 've always of that to be uh really one of the best forms of exercise
sv/2229_A_197001	but it 's terribly boring
sd/2229_A_197002	and so i really do n't ever keep a program up consistently .
qy/2229_B_197003	have you ever had any injuries from jogging ?
nn/2229_A_197004	no
sd/2229_A_197005	i never have .
sv/2229_A_197006	well i do n't job enough i think to develop any injuries
sd/2229_A_197007	i usually only go about a mile or two .
sd/2229_B_197008	i guess it worries me about jogging it 's that i hear that it 's very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse .
b/2229_A_197009	yeah
sv/2229_A_197010	it 's it 's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt .
b/2229_B_197011	uhhuh .
sv/2229_A_197012	suppose to be much better if you find grass uh or or dirt to jog on .
b/2229_B_197013	yeah
sv/2229_B_197014	that 's not quite so so easy .
sv/2229_A_197015	you have to have the right type of shoes too
sv/2229_A_197016	that 's very important .
b/2229_B_197017	yeah .
b/2229_B_197018	yeah .
sd/2229_B_197019	i found that true especially from walking on toe and fronts .
%/2229_A_197020	but
b/2229_A_197021	yeah
sd/2229_A_197022	i do n't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
sd/2229_A_197023	my do n't get very much use .
sv/2229_B_197024	well i guess my breakdown about they say about every six months .
b/2229_A_197025	uhhuh .
sd/2229_A_197026	i usually enjoy the exercise i do
sd/2229_A_197027	but uh like i said i 'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program .
sd/2229_A_197028	so i 'll i 'll bicycle
sd/2229_A_197029	i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out uh on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile
sd/2229_A_197030	but then i 'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week .
x/2229_B_197031	.
x/2229_B_197032	.
sd/2229_A_197033	but uh that gets old too in a very short order
b/2229_B_197034	yeah .
sd/2229_A_197035	i 'm i 'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh uh change things a little bit
sd/2229_A_197036	i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis .
b/2229_B_197037	yeah
ad/2229_B_197038	well do n't let it collect dust .
ad/2229_B_197039	at least exercise while dusting it off .
b/2229_A_197040	yeah .
b/2229_B_197041	well .
sd/2229_A_197042	maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this string i can uh start some type of uh regular program .
b/2229_B_197043	yeah
ba/2229_B_197044	that that 'll be good .
sd/2229_A_197045	i 've always found that uh when you write things down and set goals it 's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going .
b/2229_B_197046	uhhuh .
sd/2229_A_197047	uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise
sd/2229_A_197048	an uh one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that .
b/2229_B_197049	oh .
sd/2229_A_197050	and that was very helpful
sd/2229_A_197051	we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks .
b/2229_B_197052	uhhuh .
sd/2229_A_197053	i found that to be uh very helpful .
qy/2229_B_197054	are you going to do that ?
no/2229_A_197055	uh i need to
x/2229_B_197056	.
sd/2229_A_197057	i have n't started yet
sv/2229_A_197058	but uh it 's a thought .
sv/2229_B_197059	well that sounds like something good to do then .
sv/2229_A_197060	sounds like something i should do .
b/2229_B_197061	yeah
sv/2229_B_197062	nice way to start off this spring . get back in shape .
x/2229_A_197063	.

ba/2229_A_197076	well that 's good .
sv/2229_A_197077	well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging .
b/2229_B_197078	yeah
%/2229_A_197079	it
sv/2229_B_197080	it takes it 's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect .

sv/2434_B_197199	well i think uh down here in texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns .
%/2434_A_197200	huh .
sv/2434_B_197201	and i think they need that .
sd/2434_B_197202	uh and i do have a i have a pistol .
sd/2434_B_197203	it 's a little twentytwo
sd/2434_B_197204	and i have a twentytwo or a twelve gauge shotgun .
b/2434_A_197205	uhhuh .
sd/2434_B_197206	an you know i do like to have my guns .
x/2434_A_197207	.
sd/2434_B_197208	uh i do n't know if i 'll ever use it you know .
sd/2434_B_197209	and like you my bullets to my little pistol 's probably uh about three years old .
sd/2434_B_197210	uh my gun has n't been shot in a year or two .
b/2434_A_197211	uhhuh .
sd/2434_B_197212	but uh i like to have them where handy .
sd/2434_A_197213	well up uh up in new england where i 'm from uh you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu am ammunition .
sv/2434_A_197214	and i thought that was really good .
sv/2434_A_197215	and i think if they uh
x/2434_B_197216	.
sd/2434_A_197217	takes two weeks for that system to process uh your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition .
sd/2434_A_197218	you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that .
sd/2434_B_197219	i 've never heard of anything like that .
b/2434_A_197220	yeah . uh
sv/2434_B_197221	that would be nice .
%/2434_B_197222	but a you know
x/2434_A_197223	.
sv/2434_B_197224	the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other .
aa/2434_A_197225	i i i agree .
sv/2434_A_197226	i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh to to stop the impulse buyer from uh buying it quickly and and uh maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it .
x/2434_B_197227	.
sv/2434_A_197228	but if someone 's really determined to to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place .
b/2434_B_197229	yeah
x/2434_B_197230	.
sv/2434_A_197231	and you can get them really cheap .
aa/2434_B_197232	i know
sd/2434_B_197233	i i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in uh tennessee . and uh they had a waiting period
b/2434_A_197234	uhhuh .
sd/2434_B_197235	and uh we bought it there .
%/2434_B_197236	and
qw/2434_A_197237	how long was the waiting period out there ?
sd/2434_B_197238	about nine days .
%/2434_A_197239	huh .
sv/2434_A_197240	that was n't too too bad .
aa/2434_B_197241	no .
aa/2434_B_197242	no .
sv/2434_A_197243	because if if you 're going to go buy something uh uh of that nature i think you you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it .
sv/2434_A_197244	you 're not going to react that quickly .
sv/2434_A_197245	in other words you know you do n't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day .
%/2434_B_197246	th
sv/2434_B_197247	somebody wants to do that
sv/2434_B_197248	i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms .
aa/2434_A_197249	yeah .
sv/2434_A_197250	i do too . uh because it does n't make any difference uh uh whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose .
sd/2434_A_197251	they both do the same kind of job .
sv/2434_B_197252	a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does .
aap_am/2434_A_197253	uh yeah .
aap_am/2434_A_197254	i suppose .
sd/2434_A_197255	i never got shot with either one .
h/2434_A_197256	but i do n't know uh
sv/2434_A_197257	i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun .
aa/2434_B_197258	no
sv/2434_B_197259	a shotgun 's got too much of a spread .
sd/2434_B_197260	or at least ours does .
b/2434_A_197261	yeah .
%/2434_B_197262	uh it 's you know
sd/2434_B_197263	you have a little uh thing on the bo bottom of th on top of the barrel where you you turn it
b/2434_A_197264	uhhuh .
sd/2434_B_197265	you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get .
b/2434_A_197266	oh .
sd/2434_B_197267	and the spread changes .
sd/2434_A_197268	uh i 've got a manual single shot
sd/2434_A_197269	and i guess it does n't have any any automatic features to it .
sd/2434_A_197270	the further away i get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target .
b/2434_B_197271	yeah .
sd/2434_A_197272	and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets .
sd/2434_A_197273	it 's got a hell of a kick to it .
b/2434_B_197274	yeah .
sd/2434_B_197275	my husband had a uh a police gun at one time .
sd/2434_B_197276	and i shot that thing one time .
sd/2434_B_197277	almost knocked me down .
x/2434_A_197278	.
%/2434_B_197279	and it just a li
sd/2434_B_197280	i don i forget
sv/2434_B_197281	i think it was a three fiftyseven .
h/2434_B_197282	i 'm not sure .
qy/2434_A_197283	do you belong to a gun club or you ?
sd/2434_B_197284	he belonged to one awhile back .
sd/2434_B_197285	uh since we moved
sd/2434_B_197286	we 've only been here in texas for about a year
b/2434_A_197287	uhhuh .
sd/2434_B_197288	and uh we ca n't even find a place to shoot . just for target practice .
ba/2434_A_197289	no kidding .
sd/2434_B_197290	i 'd love to get used to that shotgun .
sd/2434_B_197291	we traded his pistol for that shotgun .
sd/2434_A_197292	huh . well the the uh clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive
sv/2434_A_197293	but uh it 's well worth it .
sd/2434_A_197294	you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have uh competition .
sd/2434_A_197295	uh i 've never really joined a club because i have n't got the time . not because i have n't got the desire .
sd/2434_A_197296	uh there 's an annual membership fee uh that 's that 's fairly high .
sd/2434_A_197297	plus there 's ini an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time uh uh member .
x/2434_B_197298	.
sd/2434_A_197299	so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club .
sd/2434_A_197300	plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in .
b/2434_B_197301	yeah .
sd/2434_B_197302	well that 's what my husband
sd/2434_B_197303	when he was in that gun club where he was doing that .
%/2434_B_197304	it you know
sd/2434_B_197305	he went mostly just to uh shoot at paper targets .
b/2434_A_197306	uhhuh .
sd/2434_B_197307	uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that .
sv/2434_A_197308	i think that that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose .
sv/2434_A_197309	in fact i 'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon .
ba/2434_B_197310	that 's a good
sd/2434_B_197311	i 've never thought of that .
x/2434_A_197312	.
ba/2434_B_197313	that 's a good point .
%/2434_A_197314	and you know it it
sv/2434_A_197315	even after you wait your nine days if you do n't know how to handle it it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that does n't know how to drive .
sd/2434_A_197316	and you give him a license because he waited nine days .
b/2434_B_197317	yeah .
%/2434_B_197318	that 's
%/2434_B_197319	and yeah .
sv/2434_A_197320	he could he could not only uh uh shoot himself .
sv/2434_A_197321	he could he could uh mishandle a weapon . leave it at home and let a child get at it .
%/2434_B_197322	it
sd/2434_B_197323	well we uh we was living on a navy base down in memphis
sd/2434_B_197324	and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something .
sd/2434_B_197325	and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot .
ba/2434_A_197326	wow .
sv/2434_A_197327	he was fortunate .
sd/2434_A_197328	he could he could of hit something else .
sd/2434_B_197329	well he went tumbling down the steps along with uh shooting his foot almost off .
sd/2434_B_197330	he broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things i 'm sure being mister cowboy .
ba/2434_A_197331	wow .
x/2434_A_197332	.
sd/2434_B_197333	i ca n't remember what the na the term was going around .
sd/2434_B_197334	it was about four or five years ago .
x/2434_A_197335	.
sv/2434_B_197336	but . now i guess that would be a good idea .
bf/2434_A_197337	about uh private citizens selling a weapons ?
sd/2434_A_197338	like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me .
qo/2434_A_197339	how do you feel about that ?
qy/2434_A_197340	do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the uh buyer and the seller ?
qrr/2434_A_197341	and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it ?
x/2434_B_197342	.
h/2434_B_197343	uh that 's a hard one because we did that .
sd/2434_B_197344	but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it .
%/2434_B_197345	i 'll uh you know
sv/2434_B_197346	the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun 's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are going to come to you .
b/2434_A_197347	yeah .
qy/2434_A_197348	i is n't there a way to uh to deregister yourself after you register a gun ?
%/2434_B_197349	uh
no/2434_B_197350	i have no idea .
sd/2434_B_197351	i 've only had one gun
%/2434_A_197352	because i have
sd/2434_B_197353	and i 've kept it you know the one gun that was in my name .
b/2434_A_197354	yeah .
qy/2434_A_197355	is it registered ?
ny/2434_B_197356	yeah .
%/2434_B_197357	i
sd/2434_A_197358	the uh the rifle that i 've got is not registered
x/2434_B_197359	.
sd/2434_A_197360	and uh i do n't know why i never registered it
%/2434_A_197361	but the uh
sv/2434_B_197362	i do n't think you have to register a shotgun .
sv/2434_A_197363	um i i think it 's it 's voluntary .
%/2434_A_197364	the uh the
sd/2434_B_197365	well see uh my husband has a thing .
sd/2434_B_197366	if they go to uh regulating uh all right uh banning guns . pri pri pri private cit citizens
b/2434_A_197367	yeah .
%/2434_B_197368	this
sd/2434_B_197369	my kid is jumping on me .
sd/2434_B_197370	i ca n't hardly talk .
x/2434_A_197371	.
sd/2434_B_197372	my husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns .
aap_am/2434_A_197373	yeah .
aap_am/2434_A_197374	i guess that could happen .
sv/2434_A_197375	it 's just like the uh the social security system .
sd/2434_A_197376	once they uh they gave everybody a number
sd/2434_A_197377	and now they 're making you uh uh get one at at birth .
x/2434_B_197378	.
sd/2434_A_197379	and once they have your number they have your identification .
b/2434_B_197380	yeah .
sv/2434_A_197381	and if you try to do anything uh like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are .
aa/2434_B_197382	yeah .
^2/2434_B_197383	and everything about you .
aa/2434_A_197384	and that 's true .

sv/2434_B_197395	they they probably know everything from half the time wh ho what time you go to the bathroom .
aa/2434_A_197396	they probably do .
ar/2434_B_197397	no
sv/2434_B_197398	that 's that 's a little bit extreme .
sv/2434_B_197399	but they could know anything and everything about you .
sd/2434_B_197400	and uh i 'd like to have my gun .
sd/2434_B_197401	if they go to banding banning them i 'd lose my gun
sd/2434_B_197402	but we would n't lose our pis our uh shotgun .
b/2434_A_197403	yeah .
sd/2434_B_197404	and uh we 're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about .
b/2434_A_197405	uhhuh .

nn/2434_B_197408	no .
b^m/2434_A_197409	no .

ny/2434_B_197431	yeah .
b/2434_A_197432	yeah .
sv/2434_B_197433	you know . and i 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun .
sv/2434_A_197434	huh . and i think the federal government is uh is really far away from uh uh control .
sd/2434_A_197435	i i do n't believe in uh
sd/2434_A_197436	i 'm s i should n't probably say control .
sd/2434_A_197437	i mean regulation .
sd/2434_A_197438	control is something that i would n't want the federal government to have .
sd/2434_A_197439	uh but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons .
aa/2434_B_197440	yeah .
sv/2434_B_197441	well i agree with you there .
sv/2434_B_197442	they do have too much control over us already .
b/2434_A_197443	yeah .
sd/2434_B_197444	uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have .
sv/2434_A_197445	unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money
sv/2434_A_197446	so i ca n't complain too much .
b/2434_B_197447	yeah
sv/2434_B_197448	i guess so .
h/2434_B_197449	i do n't know .

sd/2441_B_197454	i have n't either .
sv/2441_A_197455	i 've i 've always felt for a long time that i i think that all young kids ought to do a stint uh primarily in the military .

%/2441_A_197457	uh .

sd/2441_A_197501	and after after wasting the first six years partying and everything else i decided uhhuh time to settle down and do something .
sd/2441_A_197502	so i started to work on my education .
b/2441_B_197503	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197504	course my job was such that i did n't i could n't do it as much as i wanted
b/2441_B_197505	uhhuh .
sd/2441_A_197506	and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree .
ba/2441_B_197507	that 's pretty good .
sd/2441_A_197508	but i 've been in school ever since .
ba/2441_B_197509	that 's good .
b/2441_A_197510	yeah
sv/2441_A_197511	i guess .
b/2441_B_197512	yeah
%/2441_B_197513	that 's uh
h/2441_B_197514	i do n't know .
sv/2441_B_197515	there 's other kinds of service to the country that could be done you know
b/2441_A_197516	yeah
sd/2441_A_197517	i mean if you do n't like
sd/2441_B_197518	i mean working in the national parks uh working clean up the roadsides
b/2441_A_197519	sure .
ba/2441_A_197520	exactly .
sv/2441_B_197521	i mean i 've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time *why no slash ? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but at least some of their time to look for to go out and clean up the roads . you know
aa/2441_A_197522	oh yeah
aa/2441_A_197523	absol absolutely .
%/2441_B_197524	i mean
sv/2441_A_197525	all these all this money that we 're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients
sv/2441_A_197526	and if they 're ablebodied people i do n't see any problem at all with having them go out there and and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards paint the houses .
b/2441_B_197527	yeah .
b/2441_B_197528	yeah
sv/2441_B_197529	we 'd learn service to other people in this country .
b/2441_A_197530	sure
b/2441_A_197531	sure .
%/2441_A_197532	so i 'm
sv/2441_A_197533	get something out of that money .
sv/2441_B_197534	country would benefit
b/2441_A_197535	yeah
%/2441_A_197536	i 've
%/2441_B_197537	i mean uh
b/2441_A_197538	yeah
b/2441_A_197539	yeah
sd/2441_A_197540	my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division
sd/2441_A_197541	and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and ablebodied
%/2441_A_197542	and
bh/2441_B_197543	that right .
ny/2441_A_197544	yeah
sd/2441_A_197545	and he he had all kinds of horror stories .
sd/2441_A_197546	you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks
sd/2441_A_197547	and back back in those days they also use to give you uh booklets good for uh clothing and gas and things like this .
b/2441_B_197548	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197549	they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know
b/2441_B_197550	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197551	and i 'm i jus i have a hard time dealing with that .
sd/2441_B_197552	what i hear one time i think it was on paul harvey 's uh radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like fortyfive thousand dollars .
b/2441_A_197553	uhhuh .
sv/2441_B_197554	i mean i was astounded .
sd/2441_B_197555	i do n't even make that .
aa/2441_A_197556	no
aa/2441_A_197557	i know .
sd/2441_A_197558	i you you think about you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
b/2441_B_197559	yeah
sd/2441_B_197560	and somebody 's taking that away .
sv/2441_A_197561	and and there 's probably there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy .
aa/2441_B_197562	yeah
aa/2441_B_197563	no doubt .
sv/2441_A_197564	you know it 's it 's it 's totally ridiculous
sd/2441_A_197565	and now i i i uh started out when i first got in graduate school
sd/2441_A_197566	i was going into public administration
sd/2441_A_197567	and uh quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just could n't stand it any more .
bh/2441_B_197568	is that right
ny/2441_A_197569	yeah
sd/2441_A_197570	i mean this is the kind of thing you look at .
b/2441_B_197571	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197572	you sit there
sd/2441_A_197573	and when you 're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need .
sd/2441_A_197574	well you need x number dollars for the recipients
sd/2441_A_197575	but you need x number dollars to administer the program .
sv/2441_A_197576	well just ridiculous .
b/2441_B_197577	yeah .
sv/2441_A_197578	this is ridiculous .
sv/2441_B_197579	it 's sad .
aa/2441_A_197580	it is
sv/2441_A_197581	it 's pathetic .
sv/2441_A_197582	i mean there 's got to be a different way .
sv/2441_A_197583	there 's got to be a better way .
sv/2441_A_197584	but it 'll never happen .
sv/2441_A_197585	i mean these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks .
b/2441_B_197586	yeah .
b/2441_B_197587	yeah .
qw/2441_B_197588	what would happen if the required young people to do service to the country
qh/2441_B_197589	what should they get in return i wonder .
%/2441_B_197590	like uh
sv/2441_A_197591	i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as uh
sd/2441_A_197592	and i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance .
b/2441_B_197593	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197594	give an incentive .
^2/2441_B_197595	educational or vocational training or something .
aa/2441_A_197596	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197597	something that 's going to help them along the way .
sv/2441_B_197598	and they 'll help the country eventually too because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people
aa/2441_A_197599	sure
%/2441_A_197600	i mean
%/2441_A_197601	well this
ad/2441_A_197602	i mean i mean look at the statistics
sv/2441_B_197603	and that 's only going to help .
sv/2441_A_197604	i mean it 's sad .
sd/2441_A_197605	one in five americans ca n't read
b/2441_B_197606	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197607	adults that is ca n't even read .
sd/2441_A_197608	and and we 've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math .
b/2441_B_197609	yeah .
qh/2441_A_197610	i mean what are we what are we becoming ?
sv/2441_A_197611	we 're becoming a service country .
bf/2441_B_197612	as opposed to what we were twenty years ago .
aa/2441_A_197613	yeah
sd/2441_A_197614	we were an industrial giant
sv/2441_A_197615	and now we 're no we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game .
sd/2441_A_197616	we taught them how to do it
sv/2441_A_197617	and they they did it better than we do .
b/2441_B_197618	yeah
x/2441_B_197619	.
sd/2441_A_197620	simple as that .
sv/2441_B_197621	because they have the ambition i guess .
aa/2441_A_197622	yeah
sd/2441_A_197623	simple as that .
b/2441_B_197624	yeah
sv/2441_B_197625	which is good for them
sv/2441_B_197626	but on the other hand we kind of lose out .
aa/2441_A_197627	yeah
sv/2441_A_197628	it 's terrible for us .
sv/2441_B_197629	i think that if uh young people had service to the country might give them more ambition . because they learn that serving other people is a good thing .
b/2441_A_197630	yeah .
b/2441_A_197631	yeah
sv/2441_A_197632	and and it can be good for them too .
b/2441_B_197633	yeah
b/2441_B_197634	oh yeah .
%/2441_A_197635	i mean even even the greedy kids that we 've got now ...
ad/2441_B_197636	oh god you go to the mall
sd/2441_B_197637	and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night you know
aa/2441_A_197638	i know .
%/2441_B_197639	for what .
aa/2441_A_197640	i know .
ad/2441_B_197641	give me the money
sd/2441_B_197642	and i 'll i 'll teach them something good .
sv/2441_A_197643	well you know you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house .
b/2441_B_197644	yeah .
b^m/2441_A_197645	yeah
sd/2441_A_197646	uh that 's my other complaint .
sv/2441_A_197647	parents are n't parents any more .
aa/2441_B_197648	no .
sv/2441_B_197649	they 've they 've relinquished their parenting .
b/2441_A_197650	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197651	one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble ?
b/2441_B_197652	yeah .
sv/2441_A_197653	well as a substitute teacher for a year i i can say yes .
b/2441_B_197654	yeah
sd/2441_B_197655	i mean i talked with somebody else about that another time
sd/2441_B_197656	and you know when i 's in graduate school working on my master 's degree in math i was uh teaching as part of my part of the program .
sd/2441_B_197657	and i just love teaching .
sd/2441_B_197658	that was a lot that 's probably the most fun i had .
sd/2441_B_197659	and uh it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently .
b/2441_A_197660	yeah .
b/2441_A_197661	uhhuh .
sd/2441_B_197662	and when uh when come time to get out of school i thought boy i 'd like to teach .
qw^d/2441_B_197663	but you know for for what .
b/2441_A_197664	yeah .
sd/2441_B_197665	you know i do n't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life .
aa/2441_A_197666	exactly .
sv/2441_B_197667	i mean that that 's a sad thing to think
sv/2441_B_197668	and that 's kind of selfish on my part
sd/2441_B_197669	and i admit that
aap_am/2441_A_197670	well in a way it is
sv/2441_A_197671	but you have to look out for yourself you know
aa/2441_B_197672	yeah
aa/2441_B_197673	that 's right .
%/2441_A_197674	i mean that 's some
sv/2441_A_197675	and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers
sv/2441_B_197676	that 's wrong .
aa/2441_A_197677	yeah
ba/2441_A_197678	gosh
%/2441_A_197679	i mean
sd/2441_B_197680	i 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less
sd/2441_B_197681	i saying teachers should be paid more .
aa/2441_A_197682	no
aa/2441_A_197683	i mean yeah .
sv/2441_A_197684	they do an absolutely necessary job
sd/2441_A_197685	i mean i i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that .
b/2441_B_197686	yeah .
sv/2441_A_197687	but uh i mean there 's there 's a sense of priorities here too .
b/2441_B_197688	yeah .
%/2441_A_197689	you know we need
qh/2441_A_197690	what 's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids .
b/2441_B_197691	yeah
sv/2441_B_197692	. they both have their place .
aa/2441_A_197693	yeah
%/2441_A_197694	they they
aa/2441_A_197695	sure .
sd/2441_B_197696	but you know when it gets right down to it
%/2441_A_197697	i mean one 's import
ad/2441_A_197698	i mean on the other hand i mean you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twentysix thousand dollars .
ba/2441_B_197699	that 's pretty good .
sd/2441_A_197700	well i bet you there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year .
b/2441_B_197701	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197702	i mean my other pet peeve is unions .
aa/2441_B_197703	yeah
aa/2441_B_197704	oh yeah .
sv/2441_A_197705	you know it 's just it 's it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone .
sv/2441_A_197706	there was a time when unions were needed .
^2/2441_B_197707	and they served a good function .
aa/2441_A_197708	and they served a good function
sv/2441_A_197709	but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated
sv/2441_A_197710	and they 're only there to perpetuate their own their own power structure .
sd/2441_B_197711	i remember the company my dad worked for the people there went on strike against the management .
sd/2441_B_197712	it was a steel manufacturing place
%/2441_B_197713	and they uh
sd/2441_B_197714	this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap
sd/2441_B_197715	and they were having a hard time .
sd/2441_B_197716	and they told the strikers there look
^q/2441_B_197717	we need you to come back and get this stuff done .
^q/2441_B_197718	or else we 're going to be out of business .
sd/2441_B_197719	and they would n't come back
sd/2441_B_197720	so they went bankrupt .
b/2441_A_197721	yeah .
sd/2441_B_197722	and and they all lost their jobs .
b/2441_A_197723	sure
sv/2441_A_197724	and and and that 's really what happened to the steel industry in this country .
%/2441_B_197725	and it 's like you know .
b/2441_B_197726	yeah .
sd/2441_A_197727	so many times i mean you had the uh the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time .
sv/2441_A_197728	and well that took care of that industry
aa/2441_B_197729	that 's right .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2441_A_197730	and and then and i 'll tell you
sv/2441_A_197731	detroit worked awfully hard on on stopping car manufacturing in this country .
sv/2441_B_197732	and they 're trying to do that now with the imports .
b/2441_A_197733	yeah
sv/2441_A_197734	i mean you know we 've never caught up
sv/2441_A_197735	and i do n't think we ever will .
sv/2441_B_197736	it 'll be a tough road though .
b/2441_A_197737	yeah
%/2441_A_197738	i mean here it is
sv/2441_A_197739	and we 've got we 've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars .
b/2441_B_197740	yeah .
sv/2441_A_197741	you know . and they only did it because they i guess they were embarrassed that they 're so good at it .
b/2441_B_197742	yeah .
aa/2441_B_197743	that 's about right .
ba/2441_A_197744	gosh .
%/2441_A_197745	yeah
sd/2441_A_197746	well back to the original subject
%/2441_A_197747	yeah
sv/2441_A_197748	i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service
sd/2441_A_197749	i do n't care what kind it is .
sv/2441_B_197750	it teaches them pride in their country .
aa/2441_A_197751	yeah
sv/2441_A_197752	and pride in themselves too .
aa/2441_B_197753	that 's right .
sv/2441_A_197754	they could they could i mean you could organize something just within your community . same old thing .
b/2441_B_197755	yeah
%/2441_A_197756	i mean
aa/2441_B_197757	that 's right .
sv/2441_B_197758	that 's like eagle scouts .
aa/2441_A_197759	sure .
aa/2441_A_197760	uhhuh .
sv/2441_B_197761	and that 's a great idea .
sd/2441_A_197762	i think they ought to take them and i do n't know just have sort of like a a a manpower pool and say okay look
^q/2441_A_197763	we need somebody ...
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2461_A_197764	okay
sd/2461_A_197765	we 're going to talk about the public school system what 's wrong with it an or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it .
b/2461_B_197766	okay .
ba/2461_B_197767	fantastic .
sd/2461_B_197768	well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now .
b/2461_A_197769	yeah .
sv/2461_B_197770	evidently uh that 's that 's a big problem .
b/2461_A_197771	yeah
sv/2461_A_197772	it 's amazing uh
sv/2461_A_197773	i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what they 're doing uh .
b/2461_B_197774	right .
sd/2461_A_197775	when i was in college i i enjoyed teaching
sd/2461_A_197776	'cause i did some teaching parttime
sd/2461_A_197777	and i really enjoyed that
sd/2461_A_197778	but i would n't want to go teach high school or junior high
sd/2461_A_197779	it just you know all the problems .
b/2461_B_197780	oh lord i mean yeah
sd/2461_B_197781	an you talk about stress and pressure
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2461_B_197782	i tell you what
%/2461_B_197783	it 's uh
b/2461_A_197784	yeah
sd/2461_A_197785	they 're putting in fifty sixty hours a week
sv/2461_A_197786	i 'm sure because they 've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready .
%/2461_B_197787	do
b/2461_B_197788	right .
sv/2461_A_197789	and you know and they 're being paid probably half what most people being paid .
aa/2461_B_197790	exactly
%/2461_B_197791	and
sd/2461_A_197792	and we 're paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what you know .
aa/2461_B_197793	that 's right
sv/2461_B_197794	and then they uh poof it off you know do like tarpley .
b/2461_A_197795	yeah .
%/2461_B_197796	but uh i
sv/2461_B_197797	what gets me is i ca n't believe that congress uh or our state legislature ca n't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school .
%/2461_B_197798	you know it 's uh
sd/2461_B_197799	i just do n't understand that .
b/2461_A_197800	yeah
%/2461_A_197801	it 's uh .
qy/2461_A_197802	now do you have little kids or what ?

sd/2461_B_197806	but i have a sister that 's a uh school teacher
%/2461_B_197807	and uh .
b/2461_A_197808	yeah
b/2461_A_197809	yeah
sd/2461_A_197810	my wife and i have a a three year old almost four and a a two year old .
b/2461_B_197811	okay .
sd/2461_A_197812	so we 're looking at the the older one going to school next year . not not well not this coming fall but the year after that .
b/2461_B_197813	okay
bf/2461_B_197814	so it 's getting close .
aa/2461_A_197815	yeah
sd/2461_A_197816	he 's going to be going to kindergarten
%/2461_A_197817	so .
b/2461_B_197818	right .
sd/2461_A_197819	so you know we 're we 're thinking about that .
qh/2461_A_197820	what 's that going to be like .
qh/2461_A_197821	are they going to be taught nothing
qh/2461_A_197822	or they going be taught something
sd/2461_A_197823	we 're going to we 're going to be involved in our child 's education .
sd/2461_A_197824	we 're going to be teaching him what we can at home of course because uh i guess we do n't trust the school system which is very sad uh
b/2461_B_197825	right .
sv/2461_A_197826	but . but if it does n't start at home it 's not going to go anywhere . you know
aa/2461_B_197827	exactly .
aa/2461_B_197828	right
aa/2461_B_197829	that 's true .
sv/2461_A_197830	and we 're going to try to teach him good values because you know we when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them well hey if you can play football or basketball that 's what 's important . not if you can read or write or do or un understand some science . you know
aa/2461_B_197831	exactly .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2461_A_197832	i mean give me a break
sv/2461_A_197833	that 's that 's that 's bogus .
aa/2461_B_197834	right
aa/2461_B_197835	right .
sd/2461_B_197836	well and uh you know one thing my wife and i 've talked about i are uh private schools . you know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as they 're g growing up because you know just in the dallas area um we 're not real comfortable with the with the public schools .
b/2461_A_197837	yeah .
sd/2461_A_197838	and dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling .
b/2461_B_197839	right .
sd/2461_A_197840	i could n't believe that .
b/2461_B_197841	right .
sd/2461_B_197842	you know one that 's one reason we bought a house here in plano .
sd/2461_B_197843	we were hoping you know well the school district 's going to be good you know for resale value and so on and so forth
b/2461_A_197844	yeah .
sd/2461_B_197845	but uh i can definitely uh see on down the road you know where we do have kids and are getting to that age that 's going to be a definite concern .
b/2461_A_197846	yeah
sd/2461_A_197847	we talked you talked about before about the school funding .
sv/2461_A_197848	i think there 's only going to be one solution to school funding which i do n't think will be necessarily the best way
sv/2461_A_197849	but i think what 's going to have to happen is there 's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids .
sv/2461_A_197850	that 's the only way they 're going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property and people are going to throw a fit .
%/2461_B_197851	that 's
b/2461_B_197852	yeah
%/2461_B_197853	and you know that 's
sv/2461_B_197854	taxes right now are political suicide . you know
b/2461_A_197855	oh yeah .
sv/2461_B_197856	and i do n't think any politician 's going to do that
%/2461_B_197857	so .
b/2461_A_197858	yeah
sv/2461_A_197859	and the only thing they they would think of would be tuition you know
sv/2461_A_197860	if it works at colleges it will work down below .
b/2461_B_197861	right .
sv/2461_A_197862	and you know that 's going to that 's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do .
sv/2461_A_197863	but it will be hard for those that people that have have in school because they have to pay out even more .
aa/2461_B_197864	exactly .
sv/2461_B_197865	and you know it 's going to really hurt the the middle class uh people i think . because uh they 're the ones that will probably have to to carry the brunt of the load .
b/2461_A_197866	oh yeah .
aa/2461_A_197867	that 's right .
%/2461_B_197868	so uh
sv/2461_A_197869	and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything
ba/2461_A_197870	i mean good grief what 's .
b/2461_B_197871	yeah
sd/2461_B_197872	now that 's that 's just unbelievable to me you know .
sd/2461_A_197873	i ca n't believe that .
sd/2461_A_197874	i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened .
sd/2461_A_197875	you never heard about that .
b/2461_B_197876	well yeah
sd/2461_B_197877	we did n't we did n't even think about it you know .
b/2461_A_197878	no .
qh/2461_A_197879	and now you know what do we have now .
sd/2461_A_197880	you know got kids that either got a you know a magnum gun school
ba/2461_A_197881	like good grief .
b/2461_B_197882	r right .
sv/2461_A_197883	i mean i 'd i 'd be afraid to be in school i mean b teaching or even being a student
ad/2461_A_197884	and think what what 's it going to be like for my my youngest an my oldest son when he goes to school .
qh/2461_A_197885	what 's going to happen ?
sd/2461_A_197886	i mean i i 'm afraid for him to go .
aa/2461_B_197887	exactly
aa/2461_B_197888	right .
sv/2461_A_197889	but there again you ca n't hold them back .
%/2461_B_197890	another reason yo
sv/2461_B_197891	and you want to encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school
sv/2461_B_197892	but uh you know with all the peer pressure that 's going on with all the negative things it is uh it 's a tough environment to be growing up in .
aa/2461_A_197893	yeah
sv/2461_A_197894	and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school
%/2461_A_197895	and that was
sd/2461_A_197896	well i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventynine
%/2461_A_197897	so .
b/2461_B_197898	okay .
qy^d/2461_A_197899	that was what twelve years ago i guess .
na/2461_B_197900	right .
sv/2461_A_197901	so you know it 's lot different now .
qh/2461_A_197902	and what 's it going to be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son is in high school .
aa/2461_B_197903	that 's right
aa/2461_B_197904	that 's right .
sd/2461_A_197905	i 'm afraid to i 'm afraid to even think about it .
aa/2461_B_197906	that yeah that is a scary thought
h/2461_B_197907	but uh i do n't know
sv/2461_B_197908	i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep in uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that y you can deal with the problems as they come up .
sv/2461_A_197909	. that 's all you can do .
b/2461_B_197910	yeah
%/2461_B_197911	and .
sv/2461_A_197912	you got to you got to be your child 's best friend i guess even when they 're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish
b/2461_B_197913	right .
sv/2461_A_197914	still you got to be their best friend because when they 've got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or your parents . you know
aa/2461_B_197915	exactly .
sv/2461_A_197916	an and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they 're going to be in even worse shape .
aa/2461_B_197917	that 's right .
sv/2461_A_197918	and and the schools do n't do n't really encourage to stay away from that you know
sv/2461_A_197919	the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera .
sv/2461_A_197920	they do n't teach them good values like drugs are bad .
h/2461_A_197921	i maybe i 'm wrong because i have n't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time
sv/2461_A_197922	but it just is amazing you know
b/2461_B_197923	right .
sv/2461_A_197924	need to teach them good values .
aa/2461_B_197925	that 's true
aa/2461_B_197926	that 's true
%/2461_B_197927	and uh .
sv/2461_A_197928	of course wh if i say this is a good value someone else is going to stand up and say oh no .
sv/2461_A_197929	and the a c l u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit . which is going to take twenty years to resolve you know .
b/2461_B_197930	right .
sv/2461_B_197931	well and i think uh you touched on it you know
sv/2461_B_197932	you 've got to start them at the home . you know
b/2461_A_197933	yeah .
sv/2461_B_197934	that 's where they that 's where they get the the deep rooted values
sv/2461_B_197935	and and and uh and that 's about right .
sv/2461_A_197936	that 's all you can do .
sv/2461_B_197937	then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay
%/2461_B_197938	so .
aa/2461_A_197939	that 's right .
fc/2461_A_197940	well i got to be going

sd/2503_A_197988	uh the woman needed someone to babysit
sd/2503_A_197989	and uh this is what she had told the kids
sd/2503_A_197990	and she even told me that .
sd/2503_A_197991	and after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it .
sv/2503_A_197992	well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it 's uh you become you become attached to it .
aa/2503_B_197993	oh for sure .
b/2503_B_197994	oh yeah .
sd/2503_A_197995	so i 've had this dog now for for sixteen years

sd/2503_A_197997	uh she 's uh however getting a little old
sd/2503_A_197998	and things are starting to fail .
sd/2503_A_197999	uh i i live alone now
sd/2503_A_198000	and she stays in the house all day while i go to work
sd/2503_A_198001	and uh she 's been holding herself pretty well . the uh up until you know recently where she 's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
sd/2503_A_198002	and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home .
sd/2503_A_198003	but she 's she 's usually pretty good .
b/2503_B_198004	yes
sd/2503_B_198005	well . my my mother has one that 's uh
sd/2503_B_198006	it 's uh it 's uh teacup

%/2503_B_198008	but you know just i e e you know
sd/2503_B_198009	the way my mom 's presence countenance is just just for having a puppy
%/2503_B_198010	but you know having this dog
sd/2503_B_198011	she 's had it for i guess three years now . oh possibly four .
b/2503_A_198012	uhhuh .
sd/2503_B_198013	but uh it was it it 's it 's really made such a difference for her .
sd/2503_B_198014	i really would like to uh
sd/2503_B_198015	i 'm a disabled person
b/2503_A_198016	uhhuh .
sd/2503_B_198017	so i 'm unable to to really take care of a pet
sd/2503_B_198018	and if that were n't so i would certainly have one .
%/2503_B_198019	i just i just
sd/2503_B_198020	it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog
b/2503_B_198021	yeah .
ad/2503_A_198022	huh . well you might want to get yourself uh an animal that does n't require much attention . like a cat .
b/2503_B_198023	oh yeah .
b/2503_B_198024	well yeah
sd/2503_B_198025	uh i i i typically am not a cat person .

sv/2503_A_198038	uh they 're not uh they 're they 're affectionate
sv/2503_B_198039	well you do n't own cats .
%/2503_A_198040	but they
%/2503_A_198041	yeah
h/2503_A_198042	i do n't know
sv/2503_A_198043	i ca n't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog .
b/2503_B_198044	yeah .

sd/2503_A_198054	well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door .
sv/2503_A_198055	i do n't know that a cat would do that uh .
b/2503_B_198056	yeah .
sd/2503_B_198057	i used to have a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life .
x/2503_A_198058	.
b/2503_A_198059	yeah .
sd/2503_B_198060	i could just walk in the door
sd/2503_B_198061	and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over .
x/2503_A_198062	.
sd/2503_B_198063	i mean she really could pick up on my mood uh the way i walked in the door .
b/2503_A_198064	yeah
b/2503_A_198065	yeah .
sv/2503_B_198066	it was uh uncanny .
sd/2503_A_198067	huh . i i think uh in a way we 're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i 'm upset and i know when she 's not feeling good too .
%/2503_A_198068	so .
b/2503_B_198069	yeah .
sd/2503_A_198070	i know like when she has an accident i know she 's not doing it on purpose .

b/2503_B_198072	yeah .
x/2503_B_198073	.
sd/2503_A_198074	uh and and you know some people might not believe that

b/2503_B_198076	sure .
ba/2503_B_198077	oh absolutely .
sd/2503_A_198078	like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out . she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did .
bh/2503_B_198079	really ?
ny/2503_A_198080	yeah .
%/2503_B_198081	that 's the way
sd/2503_B_198082	well i had that cat that i mentioned alfie .
sd/2503_B_198083	one morning you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you feed this cat some something and and you make sure that it can get to its litter box .
sd/2503_B_198084	well for some reason during the night the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
b/2503_A_198085	uhhuh .
sd/2503_B_198086	and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and and uh did not feed it right away it decided that that it was going to protest .
x/2503_A_198087	.
sd/2503_B_198088	and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me . looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it .
x/2503_A_198089	.
x/2503_A_198090	.
^q/2503_B_198091	all right . have i got your attention now ?

sd/2503_B_198095	i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day .
sd/2503_A_198096	i i do n't know that i 'd uh that i 'd trade my dog in for the world .
sd/2503_A_198097	uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me
sd/2503_A_198098	and i took her to the uh to the vet 's because she was n't eating and and uh she was n't able to jump .
sd/2503_A_198099	she you know lost all her activity
sd/2503_A_198100	and uh she stayed there for one day
sd/2503_A_198101	and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she was n't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hos dog hospital animal hospital .
sd/2503_A_198102	so i took his suggestion
sd/2503_A_198103	and i uh took the the dog to a hospital . the dog hospital there
sd/2503_A_198104	and they said they 'd keep her there for three days .
sd/2503_A_198105	well she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care .
sd/2503_A_198106	it cost me over five hundred dollars .
ba/2503_B_198107	ouch .
sd/2503_A_198108	plus the the uh the vet sent me a bill for what he did
sd/2503_A_198109	and uh then she recouped .
sd/2503_A_198110	she was okay for a couple of years .
sd/2503_A_198111	and then she got sick on me again
sd/2503_A_198112	and i brought her to a different vet this time
sd/2503_A_198113	and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything .
sd/2503_A_198114	and uh he gave me the medication the same medication that i gave her the last time
sd/2503_A_198115	and she was okay
sd/2503_A_198116	and she 's been okay every since .
sd/2503_A_198117	it 's been about two years now .
ba/2503_B_198118	huh . well that 's great
ba/2503_B_198119	it really is .
sd/2503_B_198120	i i 'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time .
b/2503_A_198121	yeah .
sd/2503_A_198122	well the see the problem is if if the if someone would have came up to me and said it 's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive .
^q/2503_A_198123	what do you want to do ?
sd/2503_A_198124	i probably would have had second thoughts .
aa/2503_B_198125	yeah .
aa/2503_B_198126	of course you would .
sd/2503_A_198127	but what they well what they do is is they say well it 's going to cost you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this
sd/2503_A_198128	and and you know and it creeps up on you .
sd/2503_A_198129	you do n't know that uh you know .
sd/2503_A_198130	you really y you do n't know what it 's going to until it 's all over .
x/2503_B_198131	.
sd/2503_A_198132	uh to give you an example . my mom had an elderly cat who uh whoever evidently got a hold of it
sd/2503_A_198133	and uh the cat got sick .
sd/2503_A_198134	so she took the cat to the vet
sd/2503_A_198135	and she had the cat there for two days
sd/2503_A_198136	and then the cat died .
sd/2503_A_198137	so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died
^q/2503_A_198138	and you owe me this bill
^q/2503_A_198139	and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat .
x/2503_B_198140	.
sd/2503_A_198141	so it cost her three hundred dollars uh
sd/2503_A_198142	and she did n't get the cat back .
%/2503_A_198143	so yeah
sd/2503_A_198144	they had to pay for all the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses .
x/2503_B_198145	.
sd/2503_A_198146	and uh you know she just brought the cat in because he was n't feeling good .
sd/2503_A_198147	so that that was kind of a surprise
b/2503_B_198148	really .
ba/2503_B_198149	geez .
%/2503_A_198150	at lea

sd/2724_A_198193	i play basketball uh couple times a week .
sd/2724_A_198194	i play softball one night a week .
sd/2724_A_198195	uh that 's what i do .
%/2724_B_198196	um .
qo/2724_A_198197	what about yourself ?
sv/2724_B_198198	that 's pretty impressive .
sd/2724_B_198199	uh i guess i bicycle .
sd/2724_B_198200	uh the amount varies
sd/2724_B_198201	as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week .
bk/2724_A_198202	uhhuh .
sd/2724_B_198203	uh i guess a play softball one night a week .
sd/2724_B_198204	and i backpack a lot over the summer .
bh/2724_A_198205	oh really ?
ny/2724_B_198206	yeah
sd/2724_B_198207	that 's that 's about the extent of it .
sd/2724_B_198208	i mean i do n't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise .
sd/2724_B_198209	but uh i guess the bicycling is the one thing i 'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise .
sd/2724_B_198210	uh but i do it mostly for fun .
b/2724_A_198211	yeah
qy/2724_A_198212	uh what do you ride uh like a bunch of hills or pretty flat ?
sd/2724_B_198213	it it it varies .
sd/2724_B_198214	uh out near my house is pretty hilly .
sd/2724_B_198215	uh but sometimes i bike to work which is about uh a fifteen mile trip each way .
sd/2724_B_198216	and that 's mostly flat .
qw/2724_A_198217	how long does that take you to get to work ?
sd/2724_B_198218	uh about fortyfive fifty minutes .
qw/2724_A_198219	how d how does that work work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that ?
b/2724_B_198220	yeah
sd/2724_B_198221	it can be a pain .
sd/2724_B_198222	uh basically uh i work on a campus
sd/2724_B_198223	so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there
b/2724_A_198224	uhhuh .
sd/2724_B_198225	uh but it 's it 's enough of a pain that i did it consistently one year
sd/2724_B_198226	i would commute every day uh
sd/2724_B_198227	but it just became such a pain .
sd/2724_B_198228	i mean we 're talking you know fortyfive fifty minutes for biking uh and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind . and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff .
b/2724_A_198229	right .
sd/2724_B_198230	it was a big hunk hunk of the day .
sd/2724_B_198231	uh and then of course another hour to get back home .
sd/2724_B_198232	uh so i 've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends .
b/2724_A_198233	yeah .
qy/2724_A_198234	do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there ?
ng/2724_B_198235	not so much .
sd/2724_B_198236	uh i guess mostly i bike on my own .
sd/2724_B_198237	i 've got a touring bike . uh though i have n't gone on any extended trips with it .
b/2724_A_198238	uhhuh .
qo/2724_B_198239	how about you
qw/2724_B_198240	what kind of biking do you do ?
^h/2724_A_198241	uh well actually my wife just got me into it
sd/2724_A_198242	and i did an did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas the cooper clinic
b/2724_B_198243	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198244	and i learned all the health benefits of you know
sd/2724_A_198245	i was a solid weight trainer
b/2724_B_198246	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198247	and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
sd/2724_A_198248	and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it
sd/2724_A_198249	so once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological ad advan advantages to it
b/2724_B_198250	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198251	so i began a program couple i do n't know probably three or four weeks ago
sd/2724_A_198252	and i did my first bike rally this saturday .
sd/2724_A_198253	i did uh forty forty miles
%/2724_B_198254	um .
sd/2724_A_198255	and uh that 's the longest i 've ever ridden so far
sd/2724_A_198256	i usually you know fifteen or twenty .
b/2724_B_198257	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198258	and it was it was kind of hilly
sd/2724_A_198259	and it was pretty tough
sd/2724_A_198260	but uh i 'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it
b/2724_B_198261	oh i see .
sd/2724_A_198262	and i i kind of held her back a little bit this this weekend .
sd/2724_A_198263	she wanted to go go go
sd/2724_A_198264	but you know she wanted to stay with me .
b/2724_B_198265	uhhuh .
sv/2724_B_198266	it 's good to have a partner .
aa/2724_A_198267	yeah
aa/2724_A_198268	it really is .
qy/2724_B_198269	are you think of doing any like centuries or ...
ny/2724_A_198270	yeah
sv/2724_A_198271	that would be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that .
b/2724_B_198272	uhhuh .
b/2724_B_198273	yeah
qy/2724_B_198274	i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like you know uh uh touring like from vermont or you know that kind of thing .
b/2724_A_198275	oh .
sv/2724_B_198276	i mean people seem to get into different aspects .
sv/2724_B_198277	one is more of a distance
sv/2724_B_198278	and one 's more just you know
sv/2724_B_198279	they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour .
sd/2724_A_198280	i 've never really looked into that .
%/2724_A_198281	that you know that 's
sd/2724_A_198282	my wife would just love that .
b/2724_B_198283	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198284	and i may do that sometime .
sd/2724_A_198285	there again i 'm just kind of a fledgling into this .
b/2724_B_198286	uhhuh .
sv/2724_A_198287	i 've it 's kind of funny .
sd/2724_A_198288	i called this number
sd/2724_A_198289	and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up .
b/2724_B_198290	yeah
b/2724_B_198291	yeah .
sd/2724_A_198292	i mean around texas you you got about five or six
sd/2724_A_198293	if you live around the dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from . because they 're really into it .
ba/2724_B_198294	oh that 's nice .
%/2724_B_198295	um .
sd/2724_A_198296	bicycling is really big here .
sd/2724_A_198297	i did n't know that and you know until i came down here and kind of caught the fever .
ba/2724_B_198298	wow .
b/2724_B_198299	yeah .
sd/2724_A_198300	because i lived in indiana all my life
sd/2724_A_198301	and you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that or above the age of fifteen or something
b/2724_B_198302	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198303	but other than that it 's nothing up there like it is down here .
b/2724_B_198304	yeah
sd/2724_B_198305	i 'm not sure why that is .
sv/2724_B_198306	i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less .
sv/2724_B_198307	i mean maybe it 's because of the winters . uh or maybe just because you know there 's there 's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west .
aa/2724_A_198308	probably .
b/2724_A_198309	yeah .
sv/2724_B_198310	so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation .
b/2724_A_198311	yeah .
sd/2724_A_198312	it there 's a lot of bikers around here .
sv/2724_A_198313	it 's it 's really neat .
b/2724_B_198314	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198315	there are a lot of a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff
sd/2724_A_198316	little texas bicyclist is like a little newspaper that comes out every month .
%/2724_B_198317	um .
sd/2724_A_198318	it 's free

ba/2724_B_198322	oh that 's terrific .
%/2724_A_198323	yeah
sd/2724_A_198324	see a little bit of texas i 've never seen before .
b/2724_B_198325	uhhuh .
qw/2724_A_198326	so uh how long have you been biking ?
sd/2724_B_198327	oh i guess as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so .
sd/2724_B_198328	uh you know i guess last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago .
bk/2724_A_198329	yeah .
b/2724_B_198330	and uh yeah
sd/2724_B_198331	i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while uh until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot .
sd/2724_B_198332	and so i thought i 'd try it too .
qy/2724_A_198333	have you ever had a uh it 's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood workup done recently or since you 've been biking to see if it
nn/2724_B_198334	no
sd/2724_B_198335	i have n't
nn/2724_B_198336	no .
sv/2724_A_198337	because it really from what i understand it really improves your uh cholesterol
%/2724_B_198338	um .
sd/2724_A_198339	and you know it uh it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is uh uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol .
b/2724_B_198340	uhhuh .
sd/2724_A_198341	it gives you increased h d ls and decreases your l d ls .
ba/2724_B_198342	oh that 's great .
b/2724_A_198343	yeah
%/2724_A_198344	so ...
b/2724_B_198345	yeah
sd/2724_B_198346	i 've i 've definitely noticed it 's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse .
b/2724_A_198347	yeah .
sd/2724_B_198348	you know it gets it down to about forty .
bh/2724_A_198349	really ?
ny/2724_B_198350	yeah .
ba/2724_A_198351	that 's good .
b/2724_B_198352	yeah .
qy^d/2724_A_198353	you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week ?
ny/2724_B_198354	yeah .
ba/2724_A_198355	man .
sv/2724_A_198356	that 's that 's hardcore .
sd/2724_B_198357	on average
%/2724_B_198358	yeah .
qw/2724_A_198359	when do you get to begin with the winters and all that ?
qw/2724_A_198360	what time of the year do you usually embark on your
qy/2724_A_198361	do you ride inside if you ca n't ride outside ?
nn/2724_B_198362	no
sd/2724_B_198363	i 'm not that hardcore .
sv/2724_B_198364	i mean there are some people
sd/2724_B_198365	in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow .
sd/2724_B_198366	they 've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires .
x/2724_A_198367	.
b/2724_A_198368	yeah .
sd/2724_B_198369	and i do n't do that .
sd/2724_B_198370	i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter .
sd/2724_B_198371	uh i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it will help your balance when you 're indoor training .
%/2724_A_198372	um .
sd/2724_B_198373	uh but i just you know more or less stocked like an exercise bike and that kind of thing . uh
%/2724_B_198374	but yeah
sv/2724_B_198375	i mean winters are kind of a problem
sd/2724_B_198376	so i 'm more or less out of shape now that i 've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks .
b/2724_A_198377	uhhuh .
sd/2724_B_198378	uh but you know up here it 's only stopped snowing since then .
b/2724_A_198379	yeah .
%/2724_B_198380	uh but yeah
sv/2724_B_198381	it 's it 's it 's it 's pretty good .
%/2724_B_198382	it 's uh
sd/2724_B_198383	the main the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore i 'll lay off it more .
b/2724_A_198384	right .
bf/2724_A_198385	so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a ...
aa/2724_B_198386	oh yeah

sd/2724_B_198390	or i 'll sometimes come in the school .
sd/2724_B_198391	it 's nice coming
sd/2724_B_198392	it 's it 's nice riding to school because it 's all along a canal path uh
sd/2724_B_198393	because it 's just it 's along the erie canal up here .
qw/2724_A_198394	so what school is it ?
sd/2724_B_198395	uh university of rochester .
bk/2724_A_198396	oh okay .
b/2724_A_198397	yeah .
sv/2724_B_198398	so it 's fairly picturesque .
b/2724_A_198399	yeah .
sd/2724_B_198400	and uh so it 's it 's it 's a good ride
sv/2724_B_198401	as long as you 're not doing it every day it 's a good ride .
aa/2724_A_198402	yeah .
aa/2724_A_198403	that 's true .
ba/2724_A_198404	sounds neat .
b/2724_B_198405	yeah .
%/2724_A_198406	it 's kind of
sd/2724_A_198407	i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and does n't want to and everything else
sd/2724_A_198408	but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week .
sv/2724_A_198409	that 's uh motivating .
b/2724_B_198410	yeah .
sv/2724_A_198411	that 's really good .
fc/2724_A_198412	well good talking to you
fc/2724_B_198413	oh it was good talking to you .
fc/2724_A_198414	and keep up the good work .
fc/2724_B_198415	okay
fc/2724_B_198416	you too .
fc/2724_A_198417	all right .
fc/2724_A_198418	take care .
fc/2724_B_198419	bye .
fc/2724_A_198420	bye .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2836_A_198421	okay .
sv/2836_A_198422	uh far as you know crime in the cities i 'm sure like in yours it 's pretty pretty bad .
sv/2836_A_198423	uh probably the biggest thing we 've got going now is the robberies
sv/2836_A_198424	and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have .
b/2836_B_198425	uhhuh .
qo/2836_A_198426	how about you ?
h/2836_B_198427	uh well i do n't actually live in the city
aap_am/2836_B_198428	but i 'd probably say that 's roughly right .
sv/2836_B_198429	i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life
sv/2836_B_198430	but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i 'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution uh and sale of drugs .
aa/2836_A_198431	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198432	prob probably right if you look at it from that stand point .
b/2836_B_198433	uhhuh .
%/2836_A_198434	what uh
qy/2836_A_198435	is there anything uh that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing ?
sd/2836_B_198436	uh where i live now it 's it 's not so bad .
sd/2836_B_198437	i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it .
sd/2836_B_198438	uh but i do have friends that live in the city
sv/2836_B_198439	and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . uh just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this .
b/2836_A_198440	uhhuh .
qy/2836_A_198441	do you live in a real small town or or out in the country ?
sd/2836_B_198442	i live out in the country
%/2836_B_198443	yeah .
qw/2836_A_198444	how far out from the city i mean do you
sd/2836_B_198445	i 'm about fifteen miles out .
b^m/2836_A_198446	about fifteen miles .
sd/2836_A_198447	i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so
b/2836_B_198448	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198449	but it 's pretty congested .
sd/2836_A_198450	we are considered in the country
%/2836_B_198451	um .
sv/2836_A_198452	but it does n't really feel like you 're in the country .
%/2836_B_198453	um .
sv/2836_A_198454	our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported .
b/2836_B_198455	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198456	however i 'm sure they 're there .
b/2836_B_198457	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198458	but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood .
ba/2836_B_198459	wow .
sv/2836_B_198460	that 's huge .
sd/2836_A_198461	and since that time everybody 's got some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices sensors and things like that .
b/2836_B_198462	uhhuh .
b/2836_B_198463	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198464	it 's cut back you know considerably
sv/2836_A_198465	but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood
sv/2836_A_198466	so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high .
qy/2836_B_198467	are there are there any theories on why this is happening ?
sv/2836_A_198468	uh i would say the majority of it 's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon .
b/2836_B_198469	uhhuh .
%/2836_A_198470	most
qw/2836_B_198471	but why ?
qw/2836_B_198472	why is it happening ?
sd/2836_A_198473	well most families most families are young
sd/2836_A_198474	and both people are working .
b/2836_B_198475	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198476	so they 're happening during the hours they 're gone from work .
b/2836_B_198477	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198478	uh so uh i would say that 's probably their prime motivation .
sv/2836_A_198479	they 'll they 'll stock your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there .
qy^d/2836_B_198480	so they 're professionals ?
na/2836_A_198481	uh they classify most of them as professionals .
%/2836_B_198482	um .
sd/2836_A_198483	uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick .
b/2836_B_198484	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198485	probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles
sd/2836_A_198486	the you know mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets
b/2836_B_198487	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198488	guns that sort of stuff .
%/2836_B_198489	um .
sd/2836_A_198490	very few you know penny penny ante stuff .
qw/2836_B_198491	well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime ?
sv/2836_A_198492	well uh the police force for one
sv/2836_A_198493	i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use .
%/2836_A_198494	uh it 's
sv/2836_A_198495	oh right now i think we are about thirty thousand people
sd/2836_A_198496	and there 's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many .
b/2836_B_198497	uhhuh .
b/2836_B_198498	uhhuh .
b/2836_B_198499	right .
%/2836_A_198500	and
sv/2836_B_198501	but i mean that 's going to tend to
sv/2836_B_198502	i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher
sv/2836_B_198503	in other words you 've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit .
sv/2836_B_198504	the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place .
%/2836_A_198505	well the
sd/2836_A_198506	course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever
sd/2836_A_198507	so they 're giving the early release uh
b/2836_B_198508	right .
sd/2836_B_198509	they 're doing that in our state too .
b/2836_A_198510	yeah
%/2836_A_198511	and and it 's
sd/2836_A_198512	i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh
%/2836_A_198513	but for the
qy/2836_B_198514	so you think that would be a deterrent ?
na/2836_A_198515	that would be certainly be a deterrent .
b/2836_B_198516	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198517	and uh not necessarily you know give in to their uh human rights desires .
ad/2836_A_198518	you know if they 're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate . uh
qw/2836_B_198519	well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty ?
sv/2836_A_198520	uh i think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty you know in a lot of cases .
sv/2836_A_198521	course i i know you ca n't be a hundred percent foolproof .
b/2836_B_198522	right .
%/2836_A_198523	uh
bf/2836_B_198524	so you 'd you 'd rather see it harder to convict somebody .
aa/2836_A_198525	i 'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody
b/2836_B_198526	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198527	and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and followthrough with that .
b/2836_B_198528	uhhuh .
%/2836_B_198529	huh .
sd/2836_A_198530	uh especially you know in the case of murder
b/2836_B_198531	right .
sd/2836_A_198532	uh i know in my case i my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eightyfive
ba/2836_B_198533	oh wow .
ba/2836_B_198534	oh my goodness .
sd/2836_A_198535	and we caught the individuals got caught
sd/2836_A_198536	we uh we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
b/2836_B_198537	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198538	and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the fortyfive to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh you know the guy only got five years .
b/2836_B_198539	uhhuh .
b/2836_B_198540	right .
ba/2836_B_198541	wow .
sd/2836_A_198542	and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system .
%/2836_A_198543	so what what
qy/2836_B_198544	did you did you sue him under the civil system ?
br/2836_A_198545	do what now ?
qy/2836_B_198546	did you sue him under the civil system ?
nn/2836_A_198547	n no .
sd/2836_A_198548	i 'm not real familiar with that .
sv/2836_B_198549	well you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him
b/2836_A_198550	oh .
%/2836_B_198551	and
sd/2836_A_198552	well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him
sd/2836_A_198553	and they said well you know he they 're he has no job
^q/2836_A_198554	he has nothing
^q/2836_A_198555	there 's nothing that he has that that you could go after .
b/2836_B_198556	yeah .
sv/2836_B_198557	makes you wish that had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing .
aa/2836_A_198558	yeah .
%/2836_A_198559	uh very seld
sd/2836_B_198560	but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt .
b/2836_A_198561	yeah .
sd/2836_A_198562	they do n't do that here .
sd/2836_A_198563	course they pay them
%/2836_A_198564	but they do n't you do n't
sd/2836_A_198565	you or the insurance companies never see any of that money .
b/2836_B_198566	yeah
ba/2836_B_198567	that 's too bad .
sd/2836_A_198568	and uh you know and they 're right now they 're reluctant to go after him because they 're you know they 're they 're repeat offenders
sd/2836_A_198569	they uh been in jail before
b/2836_B_198570	uhhuh
b/2836_B_198571	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198572	they 've been released you know several times which is another uh deal i hate to see .
b/2836_B_198573	uhhuh .
b/2836_B_198574	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198575	but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and and uh and car theft on top of it destroys my car
b/2836_B_198576	yeah
sv/2836_B_198577	i i think that 's re
b/2836_B_198578	yeah .
b/2836_B_198579	yeah .
sd/2836_A_198580	and we 're out you know uh you know fifteen thousand dollars
sd/2836_A_198581	and you know the guy gets out in two months
ba/2836_B_198582	that 's awful .
sd/2836_A_198583	and he goes out and commits it again .
sd/2836_A_198584	fact he 's back in jail now .
%/2836_A_198585	so what what uh
sv/2836_B_198586	gives you sympathy for the vigilantes .
aa/2836_A_198587	yeah .
qh/2836_A_198588	what what deterrent does he really have ?
b/2836_B_198589	yeah .
b^m/2836_A_198590	yeah
sv/2836_A_198591	i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility .
b/2836_B_198592	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198593	uh we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually you know shot the people
ba/2836_B_198594	oh my god .
sd/2836_A_198595	and uh return offenders have
sd/2836_A_198596	they 've actually waited for them where they 've robbed you know particular neighborhood
sd/2836_A_198597	they 'll rob one house
sd/2836_A_198598	then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands .
b/2836_B_198599	right .
sd/2836_A_198600	course it does n't always work out in their favor .
b/2836_B_198601	right .
sd/2836_A_198602	but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you ca n't arrest all of us
b/2836_B_198603	uhhuh .
^q/2836_A_198604	you can you know you can get some of us
b/2836_B_198605	right .
^q/2836_A_198606	you ca n't get all of us .
b/2836_B_198607	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198608	uh and we 're beginning to see more and more of that .
sv/2836_B_198609	and that that 's a deterrent too . if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake
b/2836_A_198610	yeah .
sd/2836_B_198611	here you break in
sd/2836_B_198612	and you 're going to get shot .
b/2836_A_198613	yeah
sv/2836_A_198614	that 's i mean that 's certainly a possibility in in
sd/2836_A_198615	we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death .
b/2836_B_198616	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198617	and uh it helps for a while
b/2836_B_198618	uhhuh .
sd/2836_A_198619	but then just another different set of people come in
sd/2836_A_198620	and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state .
%/2836_B_198621	huh .
sv/2836_A_198622	uh i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they 're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the the border .
ba/2836_B_198623	wow
sd/2836_A_198624	so you know people who do n't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
b/2836_B_198625	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198626	it 's not many from the local communities .
b/2836_B_198627	uhhuh .
sv/2836_A_198628	but uh it 's a problem
sv/2836_A_198629	and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties
b/2836_B_198630	yeah .
sv/2836_A_198631	would be a definite deterrent
sv/2836_A_198632	and and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people .
b/2836_B_198633	yeah .
aa/2836_B_198634	uhhuh .
aa/2836_B_198635	i mean i i tend to agree with you .
sv/2836_B_198636	i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes . uh there 's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt .
b/2836_A_198637	right .
sv/2836_B_198638	and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is uh if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship .
sd/2836_B_198639	and they lose their constitutional rights . you know
b/2836_A_198640	uhhuh .
sv/2836_B_198641	and just a lot of things that we 're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just do n't protect them .
sd/2836_A_198642	i know like in my wife 's case they made her feel like the criminal .
aa/2836_B_198643	i know
sv/2836_B_198644	and i think i think that 's ridiculous .
%/2836_A_198645	they they went to all all ...
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/3756_A_198646	okay
qy/3756_A_198647	have you painted something lately ?
ny/3756_B_198648	yes
sd/3756_B_198649	i have .
sd/3756_B_198650	that room i showed you .
b/3756_A_198651	yeah .
sd/3756_B_198652	and then since then we have painted the bedroom .
b/3756_A_198653	oh yeah
qy^d/3756_A_198654	another bedroom .
ny/3756_B_198655	yeah
qy/3756_B_198656	i showed you that one too did n't i ?
sd/3756_B_198657	the brown one .
ny/3756_A_198658	yeah .
ny/3756_A_198659	yeah .
ny/3756_A_198660	yeah .
bk/3756_B_198661	yeah
sd/3756_B_198662	the one that looks like a fudgesicle .
b/3756_A_198663	oh yeah
x/3756_A_198664	.
b/3756_B_198665	yeah .
ba/3756_A_198666	oh heavens .
sd/3756_A_198667	well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom .
b/3756_B_198668	yeah .
sd/3756_A_198669	but i get i have that problem with the the ceiling you know the uh the blown blown ceiling . you know where you get around the edge .
b/3756_B_198670	oh yeah .
aa/3756_B_198671	well that is hard .
sd/3756_B_198672	now i asked janice or somebody recently how you do that uh when you paint the ceilings you know where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with .
b/3756_A_198673	uhhuh .
b/3756_A_198674	uhhuh .
qw/3756_A_198675	well how do you get the edge though ?
br/3756_B_198676	how do you get the edge ?
aa/3756_A_198677	the the straight edge ?
sd/3756_B_198678	you just have to be real careful .
b/3756_A_198679	oh i see .
sd/3756_B_198680	we use uh uh a two inch brush with uh on a slant
b/3756_A_198681	uhhuh .
b/3756_A_198682	uhhuh .
sd/3756_B_198683	and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes .
%/3756_B_198684	but .
qy/3756_A_198685	huh . well are you going to paint the outside of your house too ?

^2/3756_A_198700	or two tone or two tone . you know .
b/3756_B_198701	yeah .
sd/3756_B_198702	there are some columns that could be painted a different color too .
b/3756_A_198703	uhhuh .
qw/3756_B_198704	what color did you paint your house ?
sd/3756_A_198705	white .
bf/3756_B_198706	on the out
sd/3756_A_198707	but i have a problem .
sd/3756_A_198708	i ca n't get up high
sd/3756_A_198709	and we ca n't paint the chimney .
ad/3756_B_198710	well you have got to get one of those ladders .
sd/3756_A_198711	we have one of those ladders .
sd/3756_A_198712	we are just not willing to get up that high .
b/3756_B_198713	oh yeah .
x/3756_A_198714	.
sd/3756_B_198715	a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house
%/3756_B_198716	and that is what he
sd/3756_B_198717	i was out there last week
sd/3756_B_198718	and he has finished everything except the chimney .
sd/3756_A_198719	well we did too .
sd/3756_A_198720	we did it in the fall
sd/3756_A_198721	and it it 's just too high .
sd/3756_A_198722	it is really scary
sd/3756_A_198723	but and the only thing i would consider doing a professional maybe doing that
b/3756_B_198724	yeah .
%/3756_A_198725	but it
sd/3756_A_198726	other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional .
sd/3756_B_198727	well our house in new mexico it was stucco
sd/3756_B_198728	but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it .
b/3756_A_198729	yeah .
sd/3756_B_198730	and we did basically seventyfive percent of the house
sd/3756_B_198731	and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff .
b/3756_A_198732	uhhuh .
sd/3756_B_198733	so i hired this man to come in and do it . a young kid .
b/3756_A_198734	uhhuh .
sd/3756_B_198735	and he came with with his own raf
qw/3756_B_198736	what do you call those things ?
qy^d/3756_A_198737	the blowers ?
nn/3756_B_198738	no
sd/3756_B_198739	those where you built like a rafter thing .
sd/3756_A_198740	oh oh oh oh i know what you are talking about . uh
b/3756_B_198741	yeah .
sd/3756_B_198742	scaffold .
sd/3756_A_198743	scaffold .
sd/3756_A_198744	that 's it .
sd/3756_B_198745	he came and did it that way
sd/3756_B_198746	and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up .
%/3756_A_198747	huh .
sd/3756_B_198748	and literally i would n't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactus
%/3756_A_198749	its
b/3756_A_198750	yeah .
sd/3756_B_198751	and if he fell he was dead
sd/3756_B_198752	and he knew that .
%/3756_B_198753	so
ba/3756_A_198754	oh my .
sv/3756_A_198755	so that was worth it getting a professional for that .
aa/3756_B_198756	yeah .
sd/3756_B_198757	plus he cleaned up my mess .
sd/3756_A_198758	oh i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney
sd/3756_A_198759	but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself .
b/3756_B_198760	uhhuh .
sv/3756_A_198761	it was n't too bad .
%/3756_A_198762	i mean you think
qw/3756_B_198763	how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside ?
sd/3756_A_198764	shoot maybe a hundred and fifty .
bk/3756_B_198765	yeah .
sd/3756_A_198766	since it is a one story
sd/3756_A_198767	but we did uh like two heavy coats over it .
sd/3756_A_198768	but then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it .
b/3756_B_198769	yeah .
sd/3756_B_198770	but that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to uh i guess to buy his paint
b/3756_A_198771	uhhuh .
b/3756_A_198772	uhhuh .
b/3756_A_198773	uhhuh .
sd/3756_B_198774	and yet he bought like seventeen gallons .
ba/3756_A_198775	my word .
sd/3756_B_198776	and anyway he when he checked out and he was using his charge card too . they only charged him for one gallon of paint . like thirteen bucks or something .
b/3756_A_198777	uhhuh .
b/3756_A_198778	uhhuh .
ba/3756_A_198779	oh my word .
sd/3756_B_198780	and he had he had the uh he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
b/3756_A_198781	uhhuh .
sd/3756_B_198782	and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
b/3756_A_198783	uhhuh .
sd/3756_B_198784	so she had to start all over again
b/3756_A_198785	uhhuh .
sd/3756_B_198786	and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninetynine or something .
ba/3756_A_198787	oh my word .
sd/3756_B_198788	and he saw .
bf/3756_A_198789	so that was really worth it . painting his own house .
aa/3756_B_198790	yeah
sd/3756_B_198791	it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff .
ba/3756_A_198792	oh my word .
x/3756_B_198793	.
ba/3756_A_198794	oh my word .
sd/3756_A_198795	well he really saved in that way .
b/3756_B_198796	yeah .
b^m/3756_A_198797	but yeah
sd/3756_A_198798	i think we are going to do uh another bathroom
sd/3756_A_198799	but i think i will probably just do it in a roller .
sd/3756_A_198800	i want to do it about the same color . and just be a little
sv/3756_B_198801	uh . rollers are so messy .
sd/3756_B_198802	we never any more .
aa/3756_A_198803	oh i know .
sd/3756_A_198804	but it 's that it 's the textured wall .
%/3756_B_198805	well a little paintbrush
qo/2335_B_198806	so what do you think ?
br/2335_A_198807	uh the causes of crime ?
sv/2335_A_198808	. um i think it was imbalance of power in the united states .
sv/2335_A_198809	it 's causing the lower class to rebel .
sv/2335_A_198810	that 's why there 's su such high crime
sv/2335_A_198811	and uh there 's crime in uh young people because they do n't have ro role models
b/2335_B_198812	yeah .
sv/2335_A_198813	see too much crime on t v
sv/2335_A_198814	and they think it 's the way to go .
h/2335_A_198815	i do n't know .
qo/2335_A_198816	what do you think ?
qw/2335_B_198817	what about
aa/2335_B_198818	i agree with the upper and lower level you know
b/2335_A_198819	uhhuh .
sv/2335_B_198820	because that 's the lowest thing for themselves
sv/2335_B_198821	plus there 's nobody for them to look up to .
b/2335_A_198822	yeah .
sv/2335_B_198823	but i also blame some of it on parents
b/2335_A_198824	okay .
sv/2335_B_198825	because parents are n't parents .
b/2335_A_198826	yeah .
sd/2335_B_198827	because i remember even when i was growing up
sd/2335_B_198828	i 'm thirtyfive
b/2335_A_198829	okay .
sd/2335_B_198830	i remember when i was growing up
sd/2335_B_198831	and i had friends
sd/2335_B_198832	they used to do stuff like you know go over to a store and steal stuff .
sd/2335_B_198833	my mother warned us it 's like i do n't care what your friends do .
sd/2335_B_198834	if you do it then that was it .
b/2335_A_198835	yeah .
sd/2335_B_198836	and i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother than from from anybody else .
^2/2335_A_198837	from anybody else .
sv/2335_B_198838	and i think that 's the basic is they have no morals any more
b/2335_A_198839	yeah .
sv/2335_B_198840	so they do n't care .
b/2335_A_198841	yeah .
%/2335_B_198842	so .
aa/2335_A_198843	yeah
aa/2335_A_198844	i think i can agree with that too .
sd/2335_B_198845	but now as far as what they can do about it i do n't know .
x/2335_A_198846	.
sv/2335_B_198847	you ca n't make parents be parents .
aa/2335_A_198848	that 's true .
sv/2335_A_198849	you got to kind of make people want to do the right thing .
%/2335_B_198850	you know .
sd/2335_A_198851	i do n't know how you do that .
sv/2335_B_198852	i guess if you gave the gave them jobs
sv/2335_B_198853	that 's another problem with the united states
sv/2335_B_198854	there 's no jobs any more .
b/2335_A_198855	yeah .
%/2335_B_198856	but .
sd/2335_A_198857	well i 've heard this one theory that if that if a kid commits a crime that uh instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent .
sd/2335_A_198858	or both of them .
sv/2335_B_198859	that would work to a point
sd/2335_A_198860	now to put the blame on the parent .
sv/2335_B_198861	well that 'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway .
sv/2335_B_198862	i do n't care what you do to them .
b/2335_A_198863	yeah .
%/2335_B_198864	you know
sv/2335_B_198865	so i think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in you know .
b/2335_A_198866	yeah .
sv/2335_B_198867	because a a a child can get into anything regar
b/2335_A_198868	yeah .
sd/2335_B_198869	i do n't care how good you they are .
b/2335_A_198870	yeah .
%/2335_B_198871	eventu at least one time
sd/2335_B_198872	but now if this is a repeated thing
sd/2335_B_198873	here with this child in juvenile
%/2335_B_198874	and or to me yeah both of them .
b/2335_A_198875	yeah .
sv/2335_B_198876	because that means she 's still not doing what she 's supposed to do .
sd/2335_B_198877	because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them um twenty twenty fortyeight hours one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars .
b/2335_A_198878	uhhuh .
b/2335_A_198879	yeah .
qy^d/2335_B_198880	i do n't know if you seen this .
b/2335_A_198881	um .
sd/2335_B_198882	it was a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know
nn/2335_A_198883	no
sd/2335_A_198884	i did n't see it .
b/2335_A_198885	i understand .
sd/2335_B_198886	and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there
^q/2335_B_198887	now they going to take me away from you .
sv/2335_B_198888	that meaned she was warned .
b/2335_A_198889	yeah .
sv/2335_B_198890	but see by that i think sometimes it 's a little late .
b/2335_A_198891	yeah .
%/2335_B_198892	you know
sv/2335_B_198893	but i 'm sure there 's something can be done .
b/2335_A_198894	yeah .
qo/2335_A_198895	what about with adults ?
qy^d/2335_A_198896	anything do any about adult crime .
ny/2335_B_198897	yeah
ad/2335_B_198898	start prosecuting they
sd/2335_B_198899	but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system .
b/2335_A_198900	yeah .
sv/2335_A_198901	well for one a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded .
sv/2335_B_198902	well they should start with the
sv/2335_B_198903	if they would get rid of .
sv/2335_B_198904	seems to me i know there 's a lot about court that people do n't understand .
sv/2335_B_198905	there 's more people in jail right now for child support okay then there are for people doing drugs .
b/2335_A_198906	uhhuh .
b/2335_A_198907	um .
sv/2335_B_198908	you ought to take all them little misdemeanor people
b/2335_A_198909	yeah .
ad/2335_B_198910	let them go
ad/2335_B_198911	let them go
b/2335_A_198912	yeah .
ad/2335_B_198913	you know give them a fine whatever
ad/2335_B_198914	make them do civic duty whatever
aa/2335_A_198915	yeah
sv/2335_A_198916	i mean seriously
ad/2335_B_198917	put them fools in there
sv/2335_A_198918	they ought to put those people to work .
sd/2335_B_198919	i call them all fools idiots whatever .
b/2335_A_198920	yeah .
ad/2335_B_198921	little rock stars put all them in there .
b/2335_A_198922	um .
ad/2335_B_198923	you know the murderers the drug dealers the user put them all in
%/2335_B_198924	jail you know
b/2335_A_198925	yeah .
ad/2335_B_198926	and let all the normal people go
b/2335_A_198927	yeah .
%/2335_B_198928	you know because okay
qy/2335_B_198929	if you write a bad check you go to jail right .
ny/2335_A_198930	yeah .
ad/2335_B_198931	let them people go .
arp_nd/2335_A_198932	well .
sd/2335_B_198933	not let them go and get out of it .
b/2335_A_198934	yeah
sv/2335_A_198935	they you still have to punish them .
ad/2335_B_198936	let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know like cleaning up the city or however they do their community time you know whatever that is .
b/2335_A_198937	yeah .
b/2335_A_198938	yeah
%/2335_A_198939	that 's
sv/2335_B_198940	but pu do n't put them in jail because they 're not hardened criminals .
aa/2335_A_198941	yeah
sv/2335_A_198942	and they 're they 're still they can provide for society
sv/2335_A_198943	whereas some of them are so far gone that they ca n't do anything good for society .
b/2335_B_198944	uhhuh .
%/2335_B_198945	so .
h/2335_B_198946	i do n't know
%/2335_B_198947	some people boy they got
sv/2335_B_198948	i think the united states has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else .
aa/2335_A_198949	yeah
sv/2335_A_198950	that 's true .
sd/2335_B_198951	now how they going to fix it i do n't know .
sv/2335_B_198952	i do n't think there is a ready solution .
aa/2335_A_198953	no
sv/2335_A_198954	i do n't think so either .
%/2335_A_198955	uh .
sv/2335_B_198956	because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it .
b/2335_A_198957	yeah .
sv/2335_B_198958	and he 's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet .
sv/2335_A_198959	and they keep taking more money from us
b/2335_B_198960	uhhuh .
%/2335_A_198961	and people are get
sv/2335_A_198962	and they do n't have any incentive to work if we 're just going to take fifty percent of it .
b/2335_B_198963	yeah .
sv/2335_A_198964	might as well steal
sd/2335_A_198965	then they do n't have to pay taxes on it .
aa/2335_B_198966	that 's it .
b/2335_A_198967	yeah .
sd/2335_B_198968	so you know they i i i know that 's bad but you know just like texas now .
b/2335_A_198969	uhhuh .
sd/2335_B_198970	they could have had a lottery .
sd/2335_B_198971	they do n't want a lottery .
qh/2335_B_198972	why not ?
sv/2335_B_198973	i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever i 'm paying you know a week or whatever and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck .
%/2335_A_198974	they 'd have a
b/2335_A_198975	yeah .
b/2335_A_198976	yeah .
sd/2335_B_198977	because you know they take
sd/2335_B_198978	and uncle sam takes his
sv/2335_B_198979	the social security which probably wo n't be here when i get that old you know .
b/2335_A_198980	um .
sd/2335_B_198981	because we 're paying for social security they using now .
b/2335_A_198982	yeah .
qw/2335_B_198983	who 's going to pay for mine ?
no/2335_A_198984	i do n't know .
%/2335_B_198985	but it 's it 's
sd/2335_A_198986	i 'm not counting on it .
aa/2335_B_198987	no
sv/2335_B_198988	you do n't count on social security .
b/2335_A_198989	yeah .
%/2335_B_198990	but it 's it 's
sd/2335_B_198991	that 's what i 'm saying
sv/2335_B_198992	they need to do something else .
b/2335_A_198993	um .
%/2335_B_198994	but .
sv/2335_B_198995	crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down .
b/2335_A_198996	yeah .
sv/2335_B_198997	and it 's going to get worse .
b/2335_A_198998	yeah .

sd/2632_A_199823	an i could n't do it .
b/2632_B_199824	uhhuh .

b/2632_B_199826	uh .
sv/2632_A_199827	and the people are are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things .
b/2632_B_199828	yeah .

b/2632_A_199837	right .
sv/2632_B_199838	so it 's interesting that you chose that topic .
b/2632_A_199839	yeah

sv/2632_B_199846	a big difference .
qo/2632_A_199847	like in what sense ?

sd/2632_A_199858	and they 'll have to bring somebody with them
sd/2632_A_199859	and they will show that they completed um four year of high school
sd/2632_A_199860	yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application they ca n't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves
b/2632_B_199861	uh .
sv/2632_B_199862	that 's bad .

fc/2632_B_200034	bye .
fc/2632_A_200035	byebye .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2752_B_200596	okay
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2752_B_200597	well yes
sd/2752_B_200598	we do have pollution in houston
%/2752_B_200599	and it
qw/2752_A_200600	how bad is it ?
qy/2752_A_200601	do you have smog like they do in california ?
%/2752_B_200602	well it it
no/2752_B_200603	some
sv/2752_B_200604	i think it depends on uh you know what the ho the cloud cover
sd/2752_B_200605	and like right now it 's uh it 's kind of overcast you know
sd/2752_B_200606	just it 's hot
b/2752_A_200607	uhhuh .
sd/2752_B_200608	and the sun is trying tries to shine through
sv/2752_B_200609	but it 's it 's holding in this this pollution
%/2752_B_200610	and i
sv/2752_A_200611	it depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take it .
aa/2752_B_200612	i think so
%/2752_B_200613	and uh
b/2752_A_200614	yeah .
sd/2752_B_200615	and we have uh pasadena texas which is sort of between here an you know heading toward galveston
sd/2752_B_200616	i mean it 's still part of it 's part of the houston metroplex .
b/2752_A_200617	uhhuh
b/2752_A_200618	uhhuh .
qw/2752_A_200619	what do you think is your primary cause of it .
sv/2752_B_200620	well i think it 's industry
sv/2752_B_200621	and i think it 's cars .
qy^d/2752_A_200622	you do ?
qy/2752_A_200623	you really think cars contribute a lot now that they 've taken lead out of gas ?
%/2752_B_200624	i do n't i
h/2752_B_200625	well maybe not
sv/2752_B_200626	but it it sure it sure se
%/2752_B_200627	you know it
sd/2752_B_200628	i i know that when i 'm when i 'm behind a car
sd/2752_B_200629	and uh sometimes uh i can really smell especially diesel and things like that
b/2752_A_200630	uhhuh .
sd/2752_B_200631	you know comes right into my air conditioner
sd/2752_B_200632	and you know my head and my fa
sd/2752_B_200633	i 'm so stopped up right now
b/2752_A_200634	um
ba/2752_A_200635	my goodness .
sd/2752_B_200636	i do n't know if it 's uh if it 's partly from what 's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that
sd/2752_B_200637	that 's part of it
%/2752_B_200638	but um .
b/2752_A_200639	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200640	i think a lot of it 's industrial .
sv/2752_A_200641	i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles
sv/2752_A_200642	but it 's mostly from older automobiles .
sv/2752_A_200643	i do n't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly .
b/2752_B_200644	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200645	i think that uh i think that uh uh
%/2752_A_200646	if uh
sd/2752_A_200647	i i i heard a story a while back
sd/2752_A_200648	something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off the road that have been uh manufactured say before nineteen seventyfive that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining .
b/2752_B_200649	uhhuh .
qy/2752_B_200650	you mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from
ny/2752_A_200651	yeah .
^2/2752_A_200652	from from cars
sd/2752_A_200653	that is not not total but just from cars
%/2752_A_200654	okay .
bk/2752_B_200655	oh uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200656	so that i think would be tremendous help .
sd/2752_A_200657	but i happen to drive an old model car because it 's very economical
sd/2752_A_200658	and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service
sd/2752_A_200659	and i do n't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money .
b/2752_B_200660	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200661	on the other hand i know it 's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have .
b/2752_B_200662	uhhuh .
sd/2752_A_200663	but i do n't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies .
b/2752_B_200664	right .
sv/2752_A_200665	and uh that may be part of the problem .
%/2752_A_200666	als
qy/2752_B_200667	do you all have pollution in your co part of the country uh from industry ?
ny/2752_A_200668	yeah
ny/2752_A_200669	yeah
ny/2752_A_200670	yeah
ny/2752_A_200671	oh uh yeah
sv/2752_A_200672	it 's it 's uh pretty heavy up here i think
sv/2752_A_200673	but i think it 's mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem .
%/2752_A_200674	and and uh
sv/2752_A_200675	and uh uh people uh i do n't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should .
sv/2752_A_200676	i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in maryland .
bh/2752_B_200677	really
ny/2752_A_200678	yeah
%/2752_A_200679	and uh
%/2752_B_200680	like what ki
qy/2752_B_200681	any particular kind or just all kinds ?
sv/2752_A_200682	well for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant
%/2752_A_200683	and uh i think
sv/2752_A_200684	of course prostrate cancer 's sort of bad for everybody
sd/2752_A_200685	but uh th this state was like the second
sd/2752_A_200686	my wife 's a registered nurse
sv/2752_A_200687	and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate for just all kinds .
sv/2752_A_200688	and i ca n't help but believe that 's not partially caused from pollution .
sv/2752_A_200689	i just do n't know exactly what it necessarily is
sv/2752_A_200690	but i just ca n't believe it is .
b/2752_B_200691	um .
sd/2752_A_200692	now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph uh fluorocarbons which is the like freon twelve and freon twentytwo .
sd/2752_A_200693	they use freon twentytwo in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps
b/2752_B_200694	uhhuh .
sd/2752_A_200695	and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners
sv/2752_A_200696	and that 's also what 's causing our atmosphere to lose it 's ozone layer .
b/2752_B_200697	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200698	and i ca n't help believe if it 's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it 's ozone layer that it 's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also
sv/2752_A_200699	and having all kinds of effects
%/2752_A_200700	and .
qw/2752_B_200701	well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem ?
sd/2752_A_200702	well they 're working now
sd/2752_A_200703	i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons
b/2752_B_200704	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200705	and who ever does is going to make uh a mint .
sd/2752_A_200706	because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh
qy/2752_B_200707	is that also what 's in uh hairsp aerosol ?
na/2752_A_200708	well they used to be
sd/2752_A_200709	but they made them take it out of that .
qy^d/2752_B_200710	even so so the aerosol is still aerosol
na/2752_A_200711	right .
qy^d/2752_B_200712	but it does n't have anything that 's damaging .
nn/2752_A_200713	no
sd/2752_A_200714	they they they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers
b/2752_B_200715	uhhuh
sv/2752_B_200716	well that 's good .
sv/2752_A_200717	and that was a move in the right direction .
sd/2752_A_200718	we are doing some things to try to correct the problem .
sv/2752_A_200719	but there are more things we could do
sv/2752_A_200720	and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem .
sv/2752_A_200721	uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage
sd/2752_A_200722	i notice in this state
sd/2752_A_200723	i do n't know if you 're doing it in texas yet or not
sd/2752_A_200724	but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces uh you know containers in
%/2752_A_200725	yeah .
sd/2752_B_200726	here they 've just started started doing that
%/2752_B_200727	it 's it 's you know
sd/2752_B_200728	you 're not you do n't have to
%/2752_B_200729	but m you know
sd/2752_B_200730	i know i am .
sd/2752_B_200731	i save
b/2752_A_200732	yeah
sd/2752_A_200733	well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too .
%/2752_A_200734	but they uh
sd/2752_A_200735	in one of the counties here they 're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police .
sd/2752_A_200736	they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid
sd/2752_A_200737	and she spot checks people 's trash .
ba/2752_B_200738	no kidding
b/2752_B_200739	really
b/2752_B_200740	oh .
sd/2752_A_200741	and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they 'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time .
bh/2752_B_200742	is that right .
sv/2752_B_200743	well we need to do something
sv/2752_B_200744	we need to get serious about it .
b/2752_A_200745	yeah
%/2752_A_200746	you
b/2752_A_200747	right
sv/2752_A_200748	you 've got to get people to see i
sv/2752_A_200749	and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or where ever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it .
sd/2752_A_200750	they 've stopped that up here too .
b/2752_B_200751	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200752	but that that will cut pollution too .
sv/2752_A_200753	because you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and tr and trying to
sd/2752_A_200754	for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all .
b/2752_B_200755	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200756	but on on the other hand i do n't guess they 're polluting .
sv/2752_A_200757	but plastic containers and the like uh they may be
sd/2752_A_200758	i 'm not sure of that .
qo/2752_B_200759	how much does uh planting more trees and things like that help ?
sv/2752_A_200760	oh i think that 's very important to do .
%/2752_B_200761	too .
sv/2752_A_200762	i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing .
b/2752_B_200763	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200764	and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some .
sv/2752_A_200765	i i do n't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air .
sv/2752_A_200766	i would hope that they would help some though .
sv/2752_A_200767	that 's for sure .
sv/2752_B_200768	i think uh it seems like there was something going on around here that you know
x/2752_A_200769	.
sd/2752_B_200770	we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff
b/2752_A_200771	uhhuh .
sd/2752_B_200772	and some of the stuff that they were n't supposed to do that somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway .
sd/2752_B_200773	i think they got caught .
ba/2752_A_200774	oh good .
sd/2752_B_200775	but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on .
sv/2752_A_200776	well that uh that i think may go on a lot
sv/2752_A_200777	and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late at night or something .
sv/2752_A_200778	i do n't think we have a adequate policing uh particularly on industry .
sv/2752_A_200779	uh we have good policing at least in this state and and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants
sd/2752_A_200780	because we have to go down uh once a year here in maryland and get out car 's exhaust systems checked for emission content .
sd/2752_B_200781	uh we have to uh we have to have a state inspection every year .
b/2752_A_200782	uhhuh .
qy/2752_B_200783	do you all have that ?
nn/2752_A_200784	uh no
sd/2752_A_200785	we do n't have a state inspection
%/2752_B_200786	so
%/2752_B_200787	which i
%/2752_B_200788	i don
%/2752_B_200789	i would assu
sd/2752_A_200790	but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state .
qy^d/2752_B_200791	so i 'm assu i 'm assuming that you know they check they check everything for safety
%/2752_B_200792	or
no/2752_A_200793	i do n't know
sd/2752_A_200794	uh that 's something that you 'd have to just check with your authorities .
sd/2752_A_200795	but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventythree .
qy^d/2752_B_200796	but that 's all they check for
qy^d/2752_B_200797	they do n't check how good
qy^d/2752_B_200798	if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough .
nn/2752_A_200799	no
nn/2752_A_200800	no
sd/2752_A_200801	we do n't have inspections like that .
sd/2752_A_200802	now i 'm in maryland
sv/2752_A_200803	in virginia they check that every two years i think .
sd/2752_B_200804	we do that ev every year .
sv/2752_A_200805	and i think that 's a good idea too
sd/2752_A_200806	not no not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily
sv/2752_A_200807	but i think it 's a good idea .
sd/2752_A_200808	the emission check though is required in maryland
sd/2752_A_200809	and it 's also required in virginia uh a sister state to to this one .
sv/2752_A_200810	and that 's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants .
sd/2752_B_200811	well i 'll have to check
sd/2752_B_200812	i 'm not sure if if our state inspection ever
sd/2752_B_200813	once a year has to do you know
sd/2752_B_200814	if they check the uh
b/2752_A_200815	uhhuh
sv/2752_A_200816	well if they do n't i would imagine in time they 'll get a law with . i get around to it
sv/2752_A_200817	and if they do n't then that 's something i would certainly uh uh suggest you be willing to uh uh be for in terms of uh
sd/2752_B_200818	oh i would .
b/2752_A_200819	yeah
b/2752_A_200820	yeah .
sd/2752_B_200821	i 'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything .
aa/2752_A_200822	oh yeah
aa/2752_A_200823	i i agree .
sd/2752_A_200824	now that 's another area we have n't even discussed
sd/2752_A_200825	and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh of uh like food pollution .
sd/2752_A_200826	i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution .
sv/2752_A_200827	but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries
sd/2752_A_200828	so uh hopefully we 're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food .
%/2752_A_200829	but water pollution uh
sd/2752_A_200830	i 've worried especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like .
b/2752_B_200831	uhhuh .
sd/2752_A_200832	i know a lot more people are going to bottled water .
arp_nd/2752_B_200833	well
sv/2752_B_200834	and that 's not necessarily the answer either
sd/2752_B_200835	because they 've found out that that 's just comes out of somebody 's tap .
b/2752_A_200836	yeah
b^m/2752_A_200837	tap
%/2752_A_200838	yeah .
%/2752_B_200839	so
%/2752_B_200840	but a lot of these uh
%/2752_B_200841	some of this
sv/2752_B_200842	well you know a lot of people have well water
sd/2752_B_200843	in fact in this area too
%/2752_B_200844	and an you know
%/2752_B_200845	and uh
b/2752_A_200846	uhhuh .
sd/2752_B_200847	if you do n't get it tested you do n't necessarily know what you 're what you 're drinking
sd/2752_B_200848	and i i know a lot of people you know have that
sv/2752_B_200849	and you know you have to wonder if that you know could have an adverse affect on them too if they do n't i they do n't get it checked .
b/2752_A_200850	yeah .
b/2752_A_200851	yeah
sd/2752_A_200852	i 'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked
sv/2752_A_200853	because it seems uh
sd/2752_A_200854	when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were
sd/2752_A_200855	and we had a well
sd/2752_A_200856	it was one of those draws that
sd/2752_A_200857	i forget what you call those things
b/2752_B_200858	uhhuh .
sv/2752_A_200859	and and that was some of the best tasting water
sd/2752_A_200860	i mean i can still to this day taste that water .
%/2752_B_200861	when we were
sd/2752_B_200862	when i was growing up i lived in huntsville alabama
b/2752_A_200863	yeah .
sd/2752_B_200864	and their water supply came from uh spring .
b/2752_A_200865	uhhuh .
sd/2752_B_200866	and it was like ice cold spring water
sd/2752_B_200867	and i guess parts of the the city still ha you know get that
sv/2752_B_200868	but uh that was that was really wonderful .
ba/2752_A_200869	oh i bet it was .
sv/2752_B_200870	it was really really good .
b/2752_A_200871	yeah
%/2752_A_200872	the
sv/2752_A_200873	once it 's been filtered an if it 's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that uh
sv/2752_A_200874	it depends of course where you are .
sv/2752_A_200875	a good well though i think is very healthy ...
sd/2753_A_200876	the latin american situation in
sd/2753_A_200877	the last development i know of was the military and financial assistance columbia for the for the drug uh control .
b/2753_B_200878	uhhuh .
sv/2753_A_200879	and i support that fully .
sv/2753_A_200880	i 'm not sure we have the right solution to it
sv/2753_A_200881	but at least we 're we 're going to the source of the problem .
sd/2753_A_200882	and the source of supply .
b/2753_B_200883	uhhuh .
sv/2753_A_200884	uh the problem is here
sv/2753_A_200885	but the source of supply is there .
aa/2753_B_200886	that 's true .
aa/2753_B_200887	very definitely so .
sv/2753_A_200888	in fact i think a lot of the
sd/2753_A_200889	i 've been to uh peru several times .
b/2753_B_200890	uhhuh .
sd/2753_A_200891	i 've never been to other parts of south america
sd/2753_A_200892	but uh i have been to peru
sv/2753_A_200893	and they need some assistance down there
sv/2753_A_200894	and i 'm sure that uh as an undeveloped country they look look for it
sv/2753_A_200895	but there is not exactly a lot of uh physical responsibility there . *listen ; probably 'fiscal ' not 'physical '
aa/2753_B_200896	no .
sv/2753_B_200897	very immature in that respect .
aa/2753_A_200898	yes
aa/2753_A_200899	right .
sv/2753_A_200900	and i i think that uh they need guidance and assistance
sv/2753_A_200901	but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also .
aa/2753_B_200902	i agree .
sv/2753_B_200903	i think that for so long power financially uh governmentally every which way was in the hands of such a few that there 's not the middle class that we we perceive .
b/2753_A_200904	uhhuh .
sv/2753_A_200905	oh no the and the poor are extremely poor .
aa/2753_A_200906	i know
^2/2753_B_200907	are extremely poor .
aa/2753_B_200908	that 's correct .
sd/2753_A_200909	i know uh some of the areas in in texas seem poor
sv/2753_A_200910	but until you 've seen some of those uh native latin americans come down from the hills you ca n't imagine what poor is .
b/2753_B_200911	uhhuh .
sd/2753_A_200912	and uh the worst scene i 've ever had i think was uh someone eating out of out of a garbage can on the streets in lima peru .
bf/2753_B_200913	and and just very happy to get that .
aa/2753_A_200914	oh yes .
aa/2753_A_200915	yes .
sd/2753_B_200916	i have a brother who spent two years in bolivia .
b/2753_A_200917	uhhuh .
sd/2753_B_200918	and this is very much his you know reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor .
sd/2753_A_200919	oh the there 's a joke
sv/2753_A_200920	the the graft and the uh payoffs down there are are an accepted way
%/2753_A_200921	and in a way
b/2753_B_200922	uhhuh
b/2753_B_200923	uhhuh .
sv/2753_A_200924	and there 's there 's a sad joke .
sv/2753_A_200925	i guess all jokes are really sad
sd/2753_A_200926	but there 's a joke about the uh ambassador from latin america that came to visit a senator in the u s and was taken to his home for dinner
sd/2753_A_200927	and the uh home was palatial .
sd/2753_A_200928	they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that
sd/2753_A_200929	and the ambassador said but i know what you make as a u s senator
^q/2753_A_200930	how can you afford all of this ?
sd/2753_A_200931	and he said come i 'll show you
sd/2753_A_200932	and he walked out in the backyard
sd/2753_A_200933	and the uh senator said do you see that hospital over there ?
sd/2753_A_200934	and the ambassador said yes .
sd/2753_A_200935	and he patted his pocket
sd/2753_A_200936	and he said fifteen percent .
sd/2753_A_200937	he said you see that school over there ?
sd/2753_A_200938	and the ambassador said yes
sd/2753_A_200939	and he pot patted his pocket and said fifteen percent
%/2753_A_200940	so
ba/2753_B_200941	oh gosh .
sd/2753_A_200942	so the next year the senator went to latin america to visit the ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home
sd/2753_A_200943	and it was twice as large and four times as many servants .
sd/2753_A_200944	he said well i know how poor your country is
^q/2753_A_200945	how can you afford this uh in such a poor country
sd/2753_A_200946	and he he said come i 'll show you
sd/2753_A_200947	and he walked out the backyard
sd/2753_A_200948	and he said do you see that hospital over there ?
sd/2753_A_200949	and the senator looked
sd/2753_A_200950	and he could n't see anything
sd/2753_A_200951	he said no .
sd/2753_A_200952	and the ambassador potted patted his pocket and said one hundred percent
%/2753_A_200953	so
b/2753_B_200954	yep .
b/2753_A_200955	yeah
%/2753_A_200956	that
sv/2753_A_200957	it 's a sad story
%/2753_A_200958	but
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/2753_B_200959	intentions intentions .
aa/2753_A_200960	yes
aa/2753_A_200961	yes
sv/2753_A_200962	but it uh it is a problem .
aa/2753_B_200963	i know .
sd/2753_B_200964	uh i have a sisterinlaw who is from nicaragua
sd/2753_B_200965	and her family
sd/2753_B_200966	her father was a fairly uh high ranking official under somoza .
sd/2753_B_200967	and when that went down the tubes they had to get out .
b/2753_A_200968	uhhuh .
sd/2753_B_200969	and seventeen children filtered through into into america through guatamala through mexico through honduras
b/2753_A_200970	um .
sd/2753_B_200971	you know two here three there one here you know this kind of thing until
b/2753_A_200972	yeah .
sd/2753_B_200973	and now uh couple of the older ones stayed or went back
sd/2753_B_200974	but the rest of them now have their american citizenship and are leading productive lives
b/2753_A_200975	uhhuh .
%/2753_B_200976	but you kn
sd/2753_A_200977	well the oth the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera and hepatitis epidemics now in in latin america .
aa/2753_B_200978	yes .
sv/2753_A_200979	and it shows the the unpreparedness for such such a problem .
aa/2753_B_200980	yes .
%/2753_A_200981	and yet they 're so
sd/2753_B_200982	oh the stories she tells you know are just unnerving just unnerving .
b/2753_A_200983	yeah .
sd/2753_A_200984	and they 're they 're so rich in resources there .
sd/2753_A_200985	they 're very rich in oil and gas .
sd/2753_A_200986	and they 're very rich in gold and silver and very rich in in uh natural resources such as the fish and uh timber and and copper and all types of uh resources
b/2753_B_200987	uhhuh
b/2753_B_200988	uhhuh .
%/2753_A_200989	but they
^2/2753_B_200990	and the uranium .
aa/2753_A_200991	yes
%/2753_A_200992	and
sv/2753_A_200993	but they do n't have
sv/2753_A_200994	it 's sort of like russia
sv/2753_A_200995	they do n't have the ability to develop it .
bf/2753_B_200996	the technology .
aa/2753_A_200997	right .
%/2753_A_200998	and they they 're very
b/2753_B_200999	well
sv/2753_B_201000	and you know they 're very willing to be taught in many cases now too
sv/2753_B_201001	but you know there 's just always this kind of resentment underlying
sv/2753_B_201002	i think that when they receive help from us they want it
sv/2753_B_201003	but they do n't want it i mean
aa/2753_A_201004	you 're you 're exactly right .
sv/2753_B_201005	it 's kind of a catch twentytwo .
aa/2753_A_201006	uhhuh .
sd/2753_A_201007	it it 's sort of illustrated by the uh world bank and international monetary fund not wanting to continue to do business there
sd/2753_A_201008	because they offer assistance then do n't get repaid .
b/2753_B_201009	yeah
b/2753_B_201010	yeah .
sv/2753_A_201011	so it 's sort of a thumbing of the nose uh approach .
sv/2753_A_201012	they need it
sv/2753_A_201013	and they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations
sv/2753_A_201014	but uh then do n't .
sv/2753_A_201015	of course it 's a very volatile government uh situation too .
b/2753_B_201016	well
sv/2753_B_201017	and i think that you know it
h/2753_B_201018	somewhat a sarcastic view
sd/2753_B_201019	but some of those drugs czars you know
sv/2753_B_201020	they they know that by pumping that poison into our system that that 's the way to bring us to our knees more on their level .
b/2753_A_201021	uhhuh .
%/2753_A_201022	you know
sv/2753_B_201023	you know that 's really uh kind of a far fetched idea
aa/2753_B_201024	i know
sv/2753_B_201025	and i do n't think people probably think those things consciously
b/2753_A_201026	uhhuh .
sv/2753_B_201027	but it 's like in any sibling rivalry
%/2753_A_201028	well the
sv/2753_B_201029	we 're hearing the same
sv/2753_A_201030	the solution discussed at one time and i think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the g the u s government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to to beef up the military and to do all other things .
sv/2753_A_201031	i think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it
sd/2753_A_201032	which would still give the uh the grower in columbia and elsewhere in latin america the uh the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for .
sv/2753_A_201033	and it would save the u s money in in the long run in how much they 're trying to do
^2/2753_B_201034	in the long run .
sv/2753_B_201035	and in the short run probably too .
aa/2753_A_201036	true .
qy/2753_B_201037	course then could you know at at some point could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind .
nn/2753_A_201038	no
nn/2753_A_201039	no .
%/2753_B_201040	you know .
sv/2753_A_201041	and i i think finding an alternate to that would be very good .
sv/2753_B_201042	i mean even their even their legal crops are things that we do n't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view coffee tobacco you know .
b/2753_A_201043	right .
b/2753_A_201044	uhhuh .
^2/2753_A_201045	argentine beef
%/2753_A_201046	yeah
%/2753_A_201047	yeah .
sd/2753_B_201048	they 're certainly legal
sv/2753_B_201049	but they 're certainly not healthy .
qy/2753_A_201050	well have we come up with a solution yet salina ?
nn/2753_B_201051	no
sd/2753_B_201052	not that i know of .
x/2753_A_201053	.
sv/2753_B_201054	but it 's been fun hashing about it i suppose .
%/2753_B_201055	at any rate
%/2753_B_201056	yeah .
b^m/2753_A_201057	yeah
b/2753_A_201058	yeah .
sd/2753_A_201059	well one of these days uh i hope we 'll find some some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones .
sv/2753_B_201060	well let 's just hope that the powers that be uh have time to a little bit once in a while to to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and i do here tonight
%/2753_B_201061	but
aa/2753_A_201062	i agree .
fc/2753_B_201063	well it 's been nice chatting with you .
fc/2753_A_201064	yes
fc/2753_A_201065	it has .
fc/2753_B_201066	i appreciate it
fc/2753_B_201067	and and tell your wife i hope we i get her again sometime too .
fc/2753_B_201068	this is fun
fc/2753_A_201069	very good .
fc/2753_B_201070	it 's kind of nice to to see old friends now you see .
fc/2753_A_201071	all right
ft/2753_A_201072	thank you salina .
fc/2753_B_201073	bye now .
fc/2753_A_201074	bye .
sv/2838_B_201075	gun control seems to be a rather uh timely topic with all that 's going on legislation wise .
aa/2838_A_201076	yes .
sd/2838_B_201077	and uh the the interesting scale that they assigned it uh the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free .
sv/2838_B_201078	i 'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess .
sv/2838_B_201079	i i do n't mind regulating all of the the guns
sv/2838_B_201080	and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types .
sv/2838_B_201081	now the the wisdom as to which types that 's going to be a debate forever i would assume .
sv/2838_B_201082	uh the method of of controlling it well that 's all into how much money you want to put into the the controls .
sd/2838_B_201083	uh one point that was made in the house hearings
%/2838_B_201084	or
sd/2838_B_201085	the representative stood up and said you know we can check a guy 's credit card instantly
^q/2838_B_201086	but uh we do n't want to check his background
sv/2838_B_201087	and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes
b/2838_A_201088	right .
%/2838_B_201089	uh
sd/2838_B_201090	but there still the the technology exists to to check it if they want .
%/2838_B_201091	so it 's it 's kind of a
sv/2838_B_201092	i guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that .
sd/2838_B_201093	and then you 've got the group of people that decide that there 's there 's no particular reason to have them at all
sv/2838_B_201094	and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
sv/2838_B_201095	and i guess i would fall more in the the realm that i like the sport issue of it
sd/2838_B_201096	but i i could give it up without too much trouble
sv/2838_B_201097	not the world 's most pleasurable thing
sv/2838_B_201098	and it costs a bit to do it uh finding ranges and things like that .
b/2838_A_201099	yes .
b/2838_A_201100	right .
sd/2838_B_201101	uh i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years
sv/2838_B_201102	but it 's just not like golf or whatever .
sv/2838_B_201103	i mean there are other things that you could go do .
sv/2838_B_201104	so uh i i do n't see the the joy of shooting as as that much of a driving factor .
sv/2838_B_201105	i think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt
b/2838_A_201106	yeah .
sd/2838_B_201107	i do n't even keep the gun in our house
b/2838_A_201108	right .
sd/2838_B_201109	so i do n't have that problem
%/2838_B_201110	but uh
sv/2838_B_201111	it 's a hard hard topic i guess .
sv/2838_B_201112	a lot of people have a hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it .
aa/2838_A_201113	they do
sd/2838_A_201114	and you boy you can get them on either side
sd/2838_A_201115	and just like you say
sv/2838_A_201116	uh well i think i i guess i 'd have to place myself uh probably seven or eight
%/2838_A_201117	because
ar/2838_A_201118	or not
sd/2838_A_201119	w w onto no control
fa/2838_A_201120	i 'm sorry excuse me that
sd/2838_A_201121	uh two or three .
b/2838_B_201122	uhhuh .
sd/2838_A_201123	i was going the wrong direction .
sd/2838_A_201124	uh because of we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house
sd/2838_A_201125	and the father kept the bullets in a separate place
sd/2838_A_201126	but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to
sd/2838_A_201127	uh he knew where booth both places were loaded the gun
sd/2838_A_201128	and they were playing cowboys and indians
sd/2838_A_201129	and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes .
%/2838_A_201130	so uh
sd/2838_A_201131	i mean it
sd/2838_A_201132	it destroyed two families uh in just that instant
b/2838_B_201133	right .
sv/2838_A_201134	and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection uh
sd/2838_A_201135	having worked at one time in baltimore
%/2838_A_201136	or
sd/2838_A_201137	i do n't know if you 're in the big city
sd/2838_B_201138	dallas .
qy/2838_A_201139	are you
br/2838_A_201140	dallas ?
ny/2838_B_201141	uhhuh .
sv/2838_A_201142	that 's a big city .
b/2838_B_201143	yeah .
%/2838_A_201144	uh then you know that uh uh
sv/2838_A_201145	if you live anywhere real close that uh
%/2838_A_201146	the safety is uh
sv/2838_A_201147	some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they are n't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and you know .
sd/2838_A_201148	but uh uh we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up .
%/2838_A_201149	uh i uh
sd/2838_A_201150	once uh uh knew a fellow that had had been a policeman
sd/2838_A_201151	and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber he 's going to assume that you know how to use it well
sd/2838_A_201152	and he 's going to you know try to shoot first .
b/2838_B_201153	right .
sd/2838_A_201154	uh so you know if he 's got one .
sd/2838_A_201155	uh and if not
sd/2838_A_201156	uh then usually they uh
sd/2838_A_201157	if he 's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you
%/2838_A_201158	i mean you know they they
b/2838_B_201159	right .
sd/2838_A_201160	he said that it it was better not to have
sd/2838_A_201161	especially myself now i 'm a widow
%/2838_A_201162	and uh
sd/2838_A_201163	i so i 'm when my handicapped son is is not at home i 'm by myself
%/2838_A_201164	but uh there 's
sd/2838_A_201165	i still wo n't have a gun in the house because he said it 's really uh playing russian roulette if you do .
%/2838_A_201166	uh
b/2838_B_201167	yeah .
sv/2838_B_201168	about the only circumstances that they 'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the the person was coming your way .
sv/2838_B_201169	once you 're surprised it 's too late .
aa/2838_A_201170	that 's right .
%/2838_B_201171	and and the rare circum
aa/2838_A_201172	that 's right .
sv/2838_B_201173	you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming
b/2838_A_201174	right .
sv/2838_B_201175	and had time to do anything about it .
aa/2838_A_201176	that 's right .
sd/2838_B_201177	and i do n't have that problem
sd/2838_B_201178	as i do n't use that argument as saying it 's worth keeping one .
sd/2838_B_201179	in the uh n r as uh claim that the uh the constitutional the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh
sv/2838_B_201180	it 's hard to know the original intent
sv/2838_B_201181	but i i do n't see it as that that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that uh yeah it 's the right to to arm a militia and as opposed to just the general public .
b/2838_A_201182	right .
sv/2838_B_201183	and you have a you have a earn a right
sv/2838_B_201184	not just a privilege as it were if you 're going to serve in the militia
sv/2838_B_201185	then you have a right to have that arm
%/2838_B_201186	but uh
aa/2838_A_201187	that 's right .
sd/2838_B_201188	you know there 's all sorts of arguments there
aa/2838_A_201189	i know .
sd/2838_B_201190	but i do n't even want to worry about what the original intent was
b/2838_A_201191	no .
sd/2838_B_201192	they did n't have this problem back then .
aa/2838_A_201193	no
aa/2838_A_201194	that 's true .
aa/2838_A_201195	that that 's that 's right
sv/2838_B_201196	so we change our rights with our social status .
aa/2838_A_201197	that 's right .
sd/2838_B_201198	they 're man given rights
sd/2838_B_201199	and they can be taken away by a man
%/2838_B_201200	so
b/2838_A_201201	right .
sd/2838_B_201202	uh the people that hide behind that i do n't worry about .
sd/2838_B_201203	they can go live in another country if they want .
b/2838_A_201204	well yeah
sd/2838_A_201205	that 's how i feel too .
sd/2838_A_201206	i know well
sd/2838_A_201207	e even here where i work uh we have a a gun club .
sd/2838_A_201208	and of course those people are very avid .
sd/2838_A_201209	they you know they say there should be no ban
b/2838_B_201210	uhhuh .
%/2838_A_201211	that it 's not
sv/2838_A_201212	but i ca n't see why any uh o on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun .
b/2838_B_201213	right .
sv/2838_A_201214	uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide
sv/2838_A_201215	but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport
%/2838_A_201216	or i mean
sd/2838_A_201217	i do n't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either .
b/2838_B_201218	right .
sv/2838_A_201219	so uh i i think they should have at least some control over over those things .
sd/2838_A_201220	uh and when you were speaking about how they can check up you know on credit cards
sd/2838_A_201221	well i i understand about the privacy act and everything
qw/2838_A_201222	but why ca n't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not .
sv/2838_A_201223	that to me would not be an unreasonable thing .
b/2838_B_201224	right .
sd/2838_A_201225	and if they do
sd/2838_A_201226	course the argument with the people in the gun club uh is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway .
b/2838_B_201227	right .
sd/2838_A_201228	and so it 's not going to be that they 're buying them .
sv/2838_A_201229	course some of them do .
b/2838_B_201230	yeah .
sv/2838_A_201231	so it it is a hard question .
bf/2838_B_201232	tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people .
sv/2838_B_201233	most regulation does
aa/2838_A_201234	right
aa/2838_A_201235	oh yeah .
%/2838_B_201236	and most
sv/2838_B_201237	it 's very difficult to uh legislate uh crooks or whatever you want however you want to word it
aa/2838_A_201238	that 's right .
%/2838_B_201239	so it 's
sv/2838_B_201240	well this may be a never ending topic .
sd/2838_B_201241	i got a couple of calls waiting on me
fc/2838_B_201242	so i 'd better let you go .
fc/2838_A_201243	okay
fc/2838_A_201244	well thanks for talking .
fc/2838_B_201245	okay bye .
fc/2838_A_201246	byebye now .
fo_o_fw_"_by_bc/3528_A_201779	night
fp/3528_B_201780	fine
ft/3528_B_201781	thank you .
sd/3528_A_201782	i understand we 're supposed to talk about spaceflight .
aa/3528_B_201783	yes .
sd/3528_A_201784	i hope you know more about it than i do .
sd/3528_B_201785	oh well i just got through renting reading uh space by uh james michener .
qy/3528_A_201786	oh is that right ?
sv/3528_B_201787	and so that uh helped out a little bit i think .
sd/3528_A_201788	i have n't read his book .
sv/3528_A_201789	i was so upset with texas that i have n't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was just horrible .
aa/3528_B_201790	well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes .
h/3528_A_201791	well
sv/3528_A_201792	and i do n't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas
sv/3528_A_201793	so i was n't sure how credible he was .
qy/3528_B_201794	oh is that right ?
qo/3528_A_201795	but anyway what do you think we 've gained from the spaceflights ?
^h/3528_B_201796	well uh i 'm not sure to be honest with you
sv/3528_B_201797	so uh this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure
%/3528_B_201798	and uh and yeah
sv/3528_A_201799	ego trip .
sv/3528_B_201800	it was nice to go there
sv/3528_B_201801	but i do n't know that it really benefitted mankind that much .
b/3528_A_201802	uhhuh .
sd/3528_B_201803	i happen to live not too far away from
sd/3528_B_201804	uh well i 've actually worked for the company that uh has been blamed for the challenger disaster . uh morton thiakol .
qy/3528_A_201805	oh is that right ?
b/3528_A_201806	uhhuh .
sd/3528_B_201807	and uh you know that 's been kind of a a real negative feeling here
sd/3528_B_201808	is
b/3528_A_201809	right .
sv/3528_B_201810	sure it was you know very unfortunate thing that occurred there
%/3528_B_201811	and it 's
qw/3528_A_201812	where do you live ?
sd/3528_B_201813	uh we live in uh utah .
bk/3528_A_201814	you live in u
qy/3528_A_201815	am i talking to utah right now ?
ny/3528_B_201816	uhhuh .
ba/3528_A_201817	oh oh great .
b/3528_B_201818	yeah .
sd/3528_A_201819	because i 'm in dallas .
b/3528_B_201820	uh
b/3528_B_201821	oh .
x/3528_A_201822	.
sd/3528_B_201823	i have a sister that lives in dallas
sd/3528_B_201824	that 's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for penney 's there .
b/3528_A_201825	i see .
b/3528_A_201826	i see .
%/3528_B_201827	so .
qy^d/3528_A_201828	carolyn rash ?
br/3528_B_201829	pardon me ?
qy/3528_A_201830	is her name rash carolyn rash ?
ng/3528_B_201831	no her name is uh my last name is skidmore .
b/3528_A_201832	i see .
sd/3528_B_201833	and her her husband 's name is his last name is weight .
b/3528_A_201834	i see .
%/3528_B_201835	and uh
sv/3528_A_201836	well you probably know a lot about it .
sv/3528_A_201837	i was n't sure that they were blaming that sp space disaster on one company .
x/3528_B_201838	.
sd/3528_A_201839	i had n't heard that .
sd/3528_B_201840	well they were .
%/3528_B_201841	there was uh
sd/3528_B_201842	apparently the specifications for the joints uh
sd/3528_B_201843	they were not to perform in uh cold weather
sd/3528_B_201844	and uh apparently there was definitely a a joint that did not seal
sd/3528_B_201845	and uh if you 've ever seen the size of those uh motors that put them into space
b/3528_A_201846	uhhuh .
sd/3528_B_201847	i mean they 're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter
b/3528_A_201848	uhhuh .
sd/3528_B_201849	and and there is a lot of pressure lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air .
b/3528_A_201850	oh yeah .
%/3528_B_201851	so it 's this book was interesting though .
sv/3528_B_201852	i uh
sd/3528_B_201853	talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come overcome to uh
sv/3528_B_201854	it 's a very complex uh situation to go into space .
aa/3528_A_201855	oh yeah
aa/3528_A_201856	i would think so too .
%/3528_B_201857	they would
sd/3528_B_201858	the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how how much of a problem it is to reenter the earth 's atmosphere .
qy/3528_A_201859	you never think about that do you ?
ny/3528_B_201860	yeah .
sv/3528_A_201861	i would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down .
b/3528_B_201862	yeah .
sd/3528_B_201863	but they have to come in at a just the right angle .
sd/3528_B_201864	if you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space
b/3528_A_201865	uhhuh .
sd/3528_B_201866	and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up .
b/3528_A_201867	right .
%/3528_B_201868	so
sd/3528_A_201869	well i saw one of some of those early space capsules at smithsonian .
sv/3528_A_201870	i 'm sure you 've seen more of them than i have
b/3528_B_201871	oh .
sd/3528_A_201872	but you could see the scorch on them you know
b/3528_B_201873	uhhuh .
%/3528_A_201874	they had though piles
b/3528_B_201875	yeah .
sv/3528_A_201876	but you could see where they would come off in the how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting .
b/3528_B_201877	yeah
sd/3528_B_201878	i 've i 've i would say i 've never i 've never seen an actual capsule .
%/3528_A_201879	well i
ad/3528_A_201880	excuse me go ahead .
b/3528_A_201881	oh yeah .
sd/3528_B_201882	i 've seen more more of the motors that that they produced out there .
b/3528_A_201883	uhhuh .
sd/3528_A_201884	well these were the ones that john glenn went up in you know and the old old ones .
b/3528_B_201885	uhhuh .
b/3528_B_201886	yeah .
sd/3528_A_201887	the very first ones
sd/3528_A_201888	the little bell type things .
sd/3528_B_201889	people have commented how uh they were surprised at how small they were .
aa/3528_A_201890	yeah
sd/3528_A_201891	they really were
%/3528_A_201892	they just uh
qy^d/3528_B_201893	looked pretty confining huh .
ny/3528_A_201894	oh yeah
sd/3528_A_201895	and uh the whole thing was small
sv/3528_A_201896	and yeah you i mean you actually put it on you know .
qy/3528_B_201897	is that right ?
na/3528_A_201898	you put it around you pretty much
sd/3528_A_201899	it was so small .
b/3528_B_201900	huh .
sv/3528_A_201901	well i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space
qy/3528_A_201902	but did he go into that in the book ?
ng/3528_B_201903	not really . uh
sv/3528_A_201904	i guess that 's just to sell us on it .
sd/3528_B_201905	one thing 's
sd/3528_B_201906	i know one thing they 've they 've mentioned that i did n't get from the book by the way
sd/3528_B_201907	but it talked about uh
sd/3528_B_201908	they 're able to manufacture uh different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost uh nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes .
b/3528_A_201909	oh yeah .
sd/3528_B_201910	it 's perfectly round .
b/3528_A_201911	uhhuh .
sv/3528_B_201912	but i 'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity .
aa/3528_A_201913	well that 's true
%/3528_A_201914	and
b/3528_B_201915	yeah .
aa/3528_A_201916	that 's right .
qy/3528_A_201917	well do you think we should continue to support it at the level
sv/3528_A_201918	well i thought probably one of the things they were doing that they did n't tell us was spying .
sv/3528_A_201919	because i think those satellites you know or not satellites but the spaceflights could really spy
b/3528_B_201920	uhhuh .
sv/3528_A_201921	and with uh with russia 's demise i did n't know if we should continue to support it at the current level .
aa/3528_B_201922	yes .
sv/3528_B_201923	uh i think they have cut it back to be honest with you . from from the glory days when they did the apollo shots to the moon .
b/3528_A_201924	yeah .
b/3528_A_201925	uh .
sd/3528_B_201926	uh i appreciate having the satellites .
sv/3528_B_201927	you know that 's certainly made it nice for other purpose .
qy^d/3528_B_201928	i do n't know if you have a satellite dish or not .
sd/3528_B_201929	we do n't
nn/3528_A_201930	no
sd/3528_A_201931	i do n't .
sd/3528_A_201932	i do n't either .
sv/3528_B_201933	but i i know that 's certainly helped a lot in that regard . uh
b/3528_A_201934	yeah .
sd/3942_A_202183	well the topic 's about government .
sd/3942_A_202184	uh i 'm not altogether sure that that 's my best topic . uh
sv/3942_B_202185	i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and uh how many people are self serving .
b/3942_A_202186	yeah .
b/3942_A_202187	uhhuh .
sv/3942_B_202188	i mean you i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt . and that people are n't self serving .
b/3942_A_202189	uhhuh .
b/3942_A_202190	uhhuh .
b/3942_A_202191	uhhuh .
sv/3942_B_202192	i mean that 's what i would like to think .
b/3942_A_202193	yeah
sv/3942_A_202194	i i i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting uh about uh uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal uh because i it seems to me that when uh government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes uh parallel to the legal codes that uh we 're focusing on the wrong thing .
b/3942_B_202195	uhhuh .
b/3942_B_202196	uhhuh .
b/3942_B_202197	uhhuh
b/3942_B_202198	yeah .
sv/3942_A_202199	maybe maybe that 's what is happening .
sv/3942_A_202200	maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that uh it becomes more evident .
b/3942_B_202201	right .
sv/3942_A_202202	perhaps things that we did n't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know et cetera like that
b/3942_B_202203	uhhuh .
sv/3942_A_202204	and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons .
b/3942_B_202205	uhhuh .
sv/3942_A_202206	and i could n't help thinking when that last quest it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about h how many things can we uh actually put a legal code on that uh how much uh should it be our uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people . you know .
b/3942_B_202207	uhhuh .
b/3942_B_202208	uhhuh .
b/3942_B_202209	yeah .
aa/3942_B_202210	yeah
sv/3942_B_202211	that makes sense .
%/3942_A_202212	um .
sv/3942_B_202213	because you start prying in people 's private lives you ruin their lives as well as
aa/3942_A_202214	that 's right .
sv/3942_B_202215	and sometimes you know i do n't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know .
b/3942_A_202216	yeah .
sv/3942_B_202217	i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past
b/3942_A_202218	uhhuh .
h/3942_B_202219	but uh sometimes i do n't know
b/3942_A_202220	uhhuh .
sv/3942_B_202221	i think it gets in the way of the better judgment .
sv/3942_B_202222	i mean just because you did something in the past does n't mean he 's not a good enough person to be a politician .
sv/3942_A_202223	i i i agree with that and uh and also that if the results that they 're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what 's you know going to the public then uh then they 'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience .
b/3942_B_202224	uhhuh .
b/3942_B_202225	uhhuh .
x/3942_B_202226	.
x/3942_A_202227	.
ba/3942_B_202228	that 's it .
sv/3942_A_202229	and uh you kn when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous .
b/3942_B_202230	uhhuh .
b/3942_B_202231	yeah .
%/3942_A_202232	the that 's that 's the thing that
sv/3942_A_202233	uh things that you do n't know uh d do do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray .
b/3942_B_202234	uhhuh .
b/3942_B_202235	yeah .
sd/3942_A_202236	people could say oh they do it
%/3942_A_202237	so i guess you know
sv/3942_A_202238	but as soon as things do get public uh there there is that terrible concern .
b/3942_B_202239	uhhuh .
%/3942_B_202240	um .
sd/3942_A_202241	so sometimes i ask myself what are uh people doing that are in the media when somebody you know comes up to office
b/3942_B_202242	uhhuh .
sv/3942_A_202243	it seems that one of the first thing that 's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines .
b/3942_B_202244	uhhuh .
aa/3942_B_202245	oh yeah
sv/3942_B_202246	i guess it 's what sells newspapers you know .
sv/3942_A_202247	it 's a very low way of living .
b/3942_B_202248	uhhuh .
%/3942_A_202249	uh so
sd/3942_A_202250	a and and and as far as uh you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it i 'm not terribly involved in it .
b/3942_B_202251	uhhuh .
sd/3942_A_202252	just in a very cursory way .
b/3942_B_202253	right .
sd/3942_A_202254	i vote
sd/3942_A_202255	and i you know try to do whatever i can on the little local area
sd/3942_A_202256	but i i i it just is not one of the things that i have uh placed uh uh a a lot of my particular time and effort into
b/3942_B_202257	yeah .
