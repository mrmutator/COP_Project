\section{Methodology}\label{sec:method}
\david{Figure out how we want to present this clearly as we use a lot of `black boxes'}
\david{We might want to rename this to utterance embeddings? And then hace a seperate section on the actual methodology?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we find utterance embeddings?
	\item Use these as features
	\item For ML algorithms (NN, SVM, NB?, Nearest Neighbor)
	\item maybe here something on datasets?
	\item ...
\end{itemize}
