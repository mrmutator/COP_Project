Traditionally, Dialog Act tagging has been based on training machine learning classification methods using hand crafted features extracted from data.
In this work, we analyse automatic Dialog Act tagging by making use of distributional embeddings for utterances; we first train a distributional semantic model that allows us to infer vector representations for utterances as a whole, and use them to train different classification models with the purpose of classifying Dialog Acts found in the Switchboard corpus.
